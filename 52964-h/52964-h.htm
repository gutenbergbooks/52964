<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:0.9em;'>AFTERNOON TEA</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty was curled up in her favourite big
easy-chair in her own study.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though called a study, because it had
been used as such during her schooldays, the
pretty room was really more like a <span class='it'>boudoir</span>.
Her desk was still there, but was now filled with
programmes, friendly letters, and social correspondence
instead of school themes or problems.
The general colouring of the room was
green, but the sash curtains of thin yellow silk,
and the heap of yellow sofa cushions, did much
to lighten the effect, and gave the room a sunshiny
air, even on a dull day. The couch, and
the two big, soft, cuddly chairs were upholstered
in yellow-flowered chintz, and on the pale green
walls hung Patty’s favourite pictures, and many
curios or souvenirs of her year spent abroad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the first of March, so the room was
brightened both by a big bowlful of yellow
daffodils and a blazing wood fire. The two
things Patty liked best in life were warmth and
colour, and so to-day she was sitting near the
fire, with the splendid yellow glory of the daffodils
in full view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she was not looking at them, for she
was poring over a book. When Patty read
she usually pored, for she was eager and
enthusiastic over any story in which she was
interested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But to-day, she was not reading a story. She
pored intently, and then, throwing back her
head, she would stare blankly at the ceiling,
thinking hard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, perhaps, she would fly to her bookcase,
tumble out two or three books, swiftly turn their
pages, and then back to her big chair and the
original book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a very small book, with a paper cover,
but it seemed to be most engrossing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two or three hours passed, and still Patty
pored over the little book, rarely turning a page.
Absent-mindedly, she rubbed her head until the
hairpins fell out, and her golden hair fell
around her shoulders, as bright a glory as the
daffodils. Vacantly she stared into the fire or
out of the window, and at last she flung her
little book across the room and exclaimed aloud:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s no use! I can’t do it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then Nan, her pretty stepmother, appeared
at the open door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty!” she cried; “in a kimono! And it’s
nearly four o’clock! Don’t you know it’s my
day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nan,” said Patty, with an anxious look in
her eyes, “what is it, of which the poor have
two and the rich have none?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gracious, Patty! What a question! I
don’t know, I’m sure. Are you going in for
more philanthropy? Because, if so, do wait
for a more convenient season.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; it isn’t philanthropy. It’s——I say,
Nan, how could a headless man write a letter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He couldn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And does a bookworm eat straight through
a book, or zigzag?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. I’ve heard the Bookworm is
only a fabled animal, like a griffin. Or, no; I
think it’s an extinct species, like the Dodo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Nan! You are so deliciously ignorant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No more so than you, or why do you ask
me these things? Now, Patty, stop this nonsense,
and get dressed. What <span class='it'>are</span> you doing,
anyway?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Nan, the loveliest scheme ever! Let
me tell you about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not now. I must go down to the drawing-room.
And you must follow just as soon
as you can. Do you hear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I hear, you old Loveliness. But just
tell me when London——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Nan had run away from the fire of questions,
and Patty drew herself up out of her
chair, stretched and yawned like a sleepy kitten,
and then proceeded to make her toilette
with expedition and despatch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as she sat in front of her dressing table,
piling her gold hair into a soft crown above her
pretty face, she frowned at her own reflection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a stupid idiot,” she informed herself.
“You don’t know anything! And you haven’t
an ounce of brains! Now, <span class='it'>what</span> is it of which
the poor have two, the rich have none, schoolboys
have several, and you have one. Well, I
can’t think of a thing but mumps or measles;
and, of course, they’re not the answer, and you
couldn’t have one measle, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she dressed, Patty took hasty glances in
the little book, and finally she left her room
and walked slowly downstairs, murmuring,
“Divide nine into two equal parts, which,
added together, make ten.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when she reached the drawing-room door,
all the puzzling problems flew out of her mind,
and she went in gracefully to greet Nan’s
guests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Patty was not yet out in society, she did
not have her name on the card with her stepmother’s,
but she always assisted Nan in receiving,
and informally asked a number of her
own friends to call, too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was Nan’s last reception day for the season,
so it was a little more elaborate than others
had been.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty wore an embroidered white <span class='it'>chiffon</span>,
which delicate material clouded bows and bands
of pale-blue satin. It was a lovely frock, and
just suited Patty’s blonde fairness. She went
around among her mother’s friends, greeting
them with pretty courtesy, and chatting easily
with them. But, after a time, her own young
friends came, and, with the two Farringtons
and Kenneth Harper, Patty went to the library,
where they could be by themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon, Mr. Hepworth came, bringing Christine
Farley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christine had been in New York only a few
weeks, but already she had lost much of her
painful shyness, and, though still easily embarrassed
by the presence of strangers, she
usually managed to preserve her poise and
self-control.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She greeted Patty with shining eyes, for the
Southern girl was warmly affectionate, and
adored Patty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And are you all settled, now, Christine, and
ready to receive callers?” Patty asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I am. I have a lovely room; not large,
but sunny and pleasant, and I will gladly welcome
you there at any time. And Mr. and Mrs.
Bosworth are such kind people. Oh, I shall be
very happy there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the work?” asked Mr. Hepworth.
“How does that come on?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all right,” said Christine, soberly, but
nodding her head with satisfaction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though shy in society, she was most practical
and unembarrassed about her art study. Not
over-conceited, but perfectly aware of the extent
of her own talent, and also of her own
ignorance. And she had a calm determination
to improve the one and conquer the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christine was pretty, in her soft Southern way.
She was small, and dainty in all her effects. Her
oval face was serious, almost sad in its expression,
but, if she were interested in a subject, it
would light up into sudden beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her clothes betokened her artistic tastes, and
she never wore dresses of the fashionable type,
but soft, clinging gowns in dull, pastel colours.
A bit of old embroidery or unusual jewelry
added an effective touch, and Christine always
looked well dressed, though her clothes cost
far less than Patty’s. The two girls were absolutely
unlike, and yet they were fast becoming
great friends. But Christine possessed almost
no sense of humour, and Patty feared she
could never be really chummy with any one who
lacked that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elise was not very fond of Christine, for she
didn’t understand her at all, and secretly
thought her rather stupid. But the boys, Roger
and Kenneth, liked the Southern maiden, with
her soft, pretty accent, and, of course, Mr.
Hepworth was her friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the whole group was fairly congenial, and
they formed a pleasant little circle in the library,
to drink their tea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry I’m late,” said a cheery voice, and
Philip Van Reypen joined them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! how do you do?” cried Patty, jumping
up to greet him. “Miss Farley, may I
present Mr. Van Reypen? I think the rest
are all acquainted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were general greetings all round, and
then Philip took his place with the rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My aunt is here,” he said, to Patty. “A
little later, perhaps, she wants to meet Miss
Farley.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So she shall,” said Patty, remembering Miss
Van Reypen’s offer to help Christine in some
way. “Will you have tea?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will I have tea?” echoed Philip. “That’s
exactly what I’m here for. Please, yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then here you are,” said Patty, handing
him a cup; “and, incidentally, do you
know how a bookworm goes through a
book?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ugh! what an unpleasant subject,” said Elise,
with a shrug of her shoulders. “Patty, do
talk of something else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t,” said Patty, solemnly; “I <span class='it'>must</span> know
about the manners and customs of a well-conducted
bookworm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean a real bookworm, or a studious
person?” asked Mr. Hepworth, who often
took Patty’s questions very seriously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean the—the entomological sort,” said
Patty, “and I’m in dead earnest. Who knows
anything about the bookworms that really destroy
books?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do,” announced Kenneth, “but nothing
would induce me to tell. Theirs is a secret history,
and not to be made known to a curious
world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pooh!” said Roger, “that’s all bluff.
Patty, he doesn’t really know anything about
the beasts. Now, I do. A bookworm is a
grub.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Philip, “the book is the bookworm’s
grub. And pretty dry fodder he must
often find it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know what you’re going to do, Patty,”
said Kenneth, in an aggrieved voice; “you’re
going to set up a pair of pet bookworms in
place of Darby and Juliet. Please understand
that I am distinctly offended, and I prophesy
that your new pets won’t be half as interesting
as the goldfish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wrong again, Ken,” returned Patty; “no
new pets could ever be so dear to my heart as
those sweet, lovely goldfish. But, if you people
don’t tell me about bookworms, I’ll have
to look in the Encyclopædia; and, if there’s anything
I do hate, it’s that. Christine, aren’t you
up on bookworms?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Christine, in a shy whisper. She
couldn’t yet become accustomed to the quick
repartee and merry nonsense of these Northern
young people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I used to have a pet bookworm,” began
Roger, “but he got into a cook-book and died
of dyspepsia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell us what it’s all about, Patty?” said
Mr. Hepworth, seeing she was really serious in
her questioning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, it’s a puzzle,—a sort of conundrum.
This is it. Suppose a history in three volumes
is placed upon a bookshelf. Suppose each volume
contains just one hundred pages. And
suppose a bookworm, starting at page one of
volume one, bores right straight through the
books, covers and all, to the last page of volume
three. How many leaves does he go through,
not counting fly-leaves, or covers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty, I’m surprised at you,” said Roger.
“That’s too easy. He goes through the three
hundred pages, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It does seem so,” said Patty, with a perplexed
look, “but, as you say, that’s too
easy. There must be a catch or a quibble
somewhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Elise, “I never could do a puzzle.
I don’t know why a hen goes across the
road, or when is a door not a door. But you’re
a born puzzlist, Patty, and, if you can’t guess
it, nobody can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Elise, you’re a sweet thing, and most complimentary.
But I know you have no talent
for puzzles, so, my dear child, I’m not asking
you. But, you men of brains and intellect,
can’t you help me out? I’m sure there’s another
answer, but I can’t think what it would
be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Patty,” said Mr. Hepworth, thoughtfully,
“I think Roger is right. If the bookworm
goes through all three volumes, he must
go through three hundred pages, mustn’t he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed!” cried Christine, her shyness
forgotten, and her eyes shining as she constructed
the picture of the books in her mind’s
eye. “Wait a minute; yes, I’m sure I’m right!
He only goes through one hundred pages.
He goes only through the second volume,
you see!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elise looked at Christine a little disdainfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t seem to have heard the conditions,”
she said. “The bookworm begins at
the first page of the first volume and goes
through to the end of the last one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I heard that,” said Christine, flushing
at Elise’s tone, which was distinctly supercilious.
“But, don’t you see, when the books are set
up on a shelf, in the usual manner, the first page
of the first volume is on the right, just up
against the last page of the second volume.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense!” cried Elise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it is so, Miss Farley!” exclaimed Philip
Van Reypen. “You’ve struck it! Look,
people!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned to a bookcase, and indicated three
volumes of a set of books.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, see, the first page of volume one is
right against the last page of volume two.
So the first page of volume two is up against
the last page of volume three. Now, what
does Mr. Bookworm do? He starts here, at
the first page of volume one. He doesn’t go
backward, so he doesn’t go through volume
one at all! He goes through volume two, and,
as soon as he strikes volume three, he strikes
it at the last page, and his task is done, his
journey is over. He has fulfilled the conditions
of the original question. See?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They did see, after awhile, but it was only the
ocular demonstration that proved it, for the
facts were hard to describe in words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elise flatly refused to see it, saying it made
her head ache to try to understand it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it was very clever of Miss Farley to
reason it out so soon,” said Philip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, wasn’t it?” agreed Patty. “I didn’t
know you had a bent for puzzles, Christine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t. But that doesn’t seem to me like
a puzzle. I can’t do arithmetical problems, or
guess charades at all. But this seems to me a
picture of still life. I can see the insides of
the books in my mind, and they are wrong end
to,—that is, compared to the way we read them.
You see, they really stand in the bookcase with
the pages numbered backward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bravo, Christine; so they do!” said Mr. Hepworth.
“Patty, that’s the answer, but, I confess,
I was ’way off myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So say we all of us,” chimed in Roger. “I
can only see through it, part of the time, even
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it a most clever catch question,” said
Philip Van Reypen. “Where did you find it,
Miss Fairfield?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a little book of puzzles; I’m trying to
guess them all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me help you, won’t you? I’m a shark
on puzzles. I slipped up on this one, I admit;
but I can do the ‘transposed, I am a fish’ kind,
just lovely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, but my bookful isn’t that kind.
They’re all of a catchy or difficult sort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, let me try to help, mayn’t I?” Mr.
Van Reypen’s voice was gay and wheedlesome,
and Patty responded by saying, “Perhaps;
some time. But now I must take Miss Farley
in to see Mrs. Van Reypen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These two were mutually pleased with each
other, as Patty felt sure they would be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Van Reypen assumed her kindest demeanour,
for she saw Christine was excessively
shy. She talked pleasantly to her, drawing her
out concerning her life work and her life plans,
and ended by asking the girl to call on her
some afternoon, soon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she went away, and Patty drew Christine
into a corner to congratulate her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s fine!” she declared. “If Mrs. Van
Reypen takes you up, she’ll do lovely things
for you. She’ll have you at her house, and
you’ll meet lovely people, and she’ll take you
to the opera! Oh, Christine, do be nice to her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I shall. I liked her at once. She
isn’t a bit patronising. But, Patty, your friend
Elise is. I don’t know why, but she doesn’t like
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense, Christine, don’t you go around
with thinks like that under your pompadour!
Elise is all right. She isn’t such a sunny bunny
as I am, but she’s a lot wiser and better in
many ways.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, she isn’t! She’s selfish and jealous. But
I’m going to be nice to her, and, perhaps, I
can make her like me, after all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say you could! Everybody likes
you, and anybody who doesn’t soon will!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span><h1>CHAPTER II</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:0.9em;'>AN ABLE HELPER</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nearly all the guests had left the
Fairfield house, after Nan’s pleasant
afternoon tea. Philip Van Reypen had
escorted his aunt out to her carriage, and she
had driven away, while the young man returned
for a few moments’ further chat with his
hostess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though he and Nan had met but a few times,
they had become rather chummy, which, however,
was not unusual for him, if he liked anybody.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Young Van Reypen was of a gay and social
nature, and made friends easily by his sheer
good-humour. He admired Mrs. Fairfield very
much, but, even more, he admired Patty. Ever
since he had met her unexpectedly on his aunt’s
staircase, he had thought her the prettiest and
sweetest girl he had ever seen. So he was making
every endeavour to cultivate her acquaintance,
and, being of rather astute observation, he
concluded it wise to make friends with the
whole Fairfield family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the big, handsome chap went back to the
drawing-room, and dropped on a sofa beside
Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s awfully cold out,” he observed,
plaintively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it?” returned his hostess, innocently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; I hate to go out in the cold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you have to go, sooner or later.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; but it may be warmer later.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the contrary, it will probably grow
colder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! do you think so? But, then again, it
may not, and I’m quite willing to take the
chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Van Reypen, I do believe you’re hinting
for an invitation to stay here to dinner!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mrs. Fairfield, how clever you are!
How could you possibly guess that, now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan laughed and hesitated. She liked the
young man, but she wasn’t sure that Patty
wanted him there. Patty was developing into
a somewhat decided young person, and liked to
make her own plans. And Nan well knew that
Patty was the real magnet that drew Mr. Van
Reypen so often to the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think?” she said, as the girl
came into the room; “this plain-spoken young
man is giving me to understand that, if he were
urged, he would dine here to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, it would require a great deal
of most insistent urging,” put in Philip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t let’s urge him,” said Patty, but the
merry smile she flashed at the young man belied
her words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you smile like that, I’ll do the urging myself,”
he cried. “Please, Mrs. Fairfield, <span class='it'>do</span>
let me stay; I’ll be as good as gold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What say you, Patty?” asked Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He may stay,” rejoined Patty, “if he’ll help
me with my work on those puzzles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Puzzles? Well, I just guess I will! I’ll do
them all for you. Where’s your slate and
pencil?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, not yet!” laughed Patty. “We won’t
do those until after dinner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you do them at all?” asked Nan;
“and what are they, anyway?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell you,” began Patty; “no, I won’t,
either. At least, not now. It’s a grand project,—a
really great scheme. And I’ll unfold
it at dinner, then father can hear about it, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, later, when the quartette were seated
around the dinner table, Patty announced that
she would tell of her great project.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” she began, “it’s a sort of advertisement
for a big motor-car company.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t try to float a motor-car company,
Patty,” advised her father; “it’s too big a project
for a young girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not going to do that, Daddy Fairfield;
but I begin to think that what I am going to
do is almost as hard. You see, this big company
has issued a book of a hundred puzzles. Now,
whoever guesses all those puzzles correctly will
get the prize. And,—the prize is a lovely electric
runabout. And I want it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hevings! hevings!” murmured Mr. Van
Reypen. “She wants an Electric Runabout!
Why, Infant, you’ll break your blessed neck!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, I won’t! I guess I’ve brains
enough to run an electric car! If I guess
those puzzles, that’ll prove it. They’re fearfully
hard! Listen to this one. ‘When did
London begin with an L and end with an
E?’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is hard,” said Nan. “It must be some
foreign name for London. But <span class='it'>Londres</span> won’t
do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Patty, “I thought of that. I
expect it’s some old Anglo-Saxon or Hardicanute
name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect it’s rubbish,” said her father.
“Patty, don’t begin on these things. You’ll
wear yourself out. I know how you hammer at
anything, once you begin it, and you’ll be sitting
up nights with these foolish questions until
you’re really ill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, I won’t, father. And beside, Mr.
Van Reypen is going to help me, lots.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Angel Child,” said Philip, looking at her
with a patronising air, “if all your questions
are as easy as that one you just quoted, your
task is already accomplished.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, do you know the answer?” cried
Patty. “Oh, tell it to me! I’ve puzzled so
hard over it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a quibble, of course,—a sort of catch,
do you see? And the answer is that London always
began with an L, and <span class='it'>End</span> always began
with an E.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” said Patty, catching the point at once,
“I should have known that! I pride myself
on guessing those catch questions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were clever to guess it so quickly, Mr.
Van Reypen,” said Mr. Fairfield; “or have you
heard it before?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not exactly in that form, no. But so many
quibbles are built like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are,” agreed Patty; “I ought to have
known it. Well, I rather think there are some
others you won’t guess so easily.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How many have you done?” asked Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve done about twenty-five out of the hundred.
Some were dead easy, and some I had to
work on like the mischief.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Patty,” began her father, “what could
you do with a motor car of your own? You
don’t want it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, I do! Why, I’ll have perfectly elegant
times scooting around by myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you can’t go by yourself in the New
York streets! I won’t allow it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, daddy dear, not here in the city, perhaps.
But, if we go away for the summer to
some nice country place, where there’s nothing
in the road but cows, then I could run it alone.
Or with some nice girl by my side.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or with some nice boy by your side,” put
in Philip. “I’m an awfully nice boy,—they
all say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you help me win it, I’ll give you a ride
in it,” said Patty. “But I haven’t won it yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, and you won’t,” said her father.
“Those contests are just planned for an advertisement.
The prize goes to the daughter of
the chief director.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Father Fairfield! What a mean thing
to say! You don’t know that that’s so at all.
Now, I believe in their honesty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I,” said Nan. “That isn’t like
you, Fred, to express such an unfounded
suspicion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, perhaps I spoke too hastily. But still,
Patty, I don’t think you want the thing. If you
get it, I’ll sell it for you, and give you the
money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir-ee! I want it for itself alone. Oh,
father, think what fun I’d have spinning around
the country! Wouldn’t we, Nan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed! I think it would be great fun.
And they say those electrics are easy to manage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pooh! as easy as pie,” declared Patty.
“And, anyway, I ran a big touring car once,
in France. A big gasoline one. An electric is
nothing to that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you do to make it go?” asked
her father, smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you just release the pawl that engages
the clutch that holds the lever that sustains the
spring that lets go the brake—and there you
are!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty! where did you learn all that jargon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“’Tisn’t jargon; it’s sense. And now, my dear
ones, will you all help me in my stupendous undertaking?
For, when I engage in a contest, I
want to win.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it winning, if you have so much help?”
teased her father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it is. The contest is to get the answers
to those hundred questions and send them in.
It doesn’t matter where you get your answers.
You don’t want to enter the contest yourself,
do you, Mr. Van Reypen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, fair lady. I would but be thy humble
knight, and render such poor assistance as
I may.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, then; right after dinner, we’ll
tackle that book of posers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so, for a couple of hours that evening,
Patty and Philip Van Reypen exerted the full
force of their intellects to unravel the knotty
tangles propounded by the little paper-covered
book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. and Mrs. Fairfield tried for a time, but
soon grew weary of the difficult game.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, take this one,” said Patty to her colleague;
“‘How do you swallow a door?’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bolt it,” he replied, promptly. “That’s an
old one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ought to have guessed that myself,” said
Patty, “I’m so fond of slang.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Bolt it,’ isn’t exactly slang.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,—I s’pose not. It’s just rude diction.
Now, answer this. ‘The poor have two, the
rich have none. Schoolboys have several, you
have one.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that’s one of a class of puzzles to
which the answer is usually some letter of the
alphabet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, of course!” cried Patty, quickly; “it
is <span class='it'>O</span>. There, I guessed that! Don’t you claim
it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, you did! Now, you know this
one about the headless man, don’t you? It’s a
classic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t. I can’t see any sense to it
at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Read it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Patty read aloud:</p>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line0'>“‘A headless man had a letter to write</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;It was read by one who had lost his sight,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;The dumb repeated it, word for word,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;And he who was deaf both listened and heard.’”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“And you don’t know that?” asked Philip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; the conditions are impossible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, they’re not. They only seem so.
The answer is, ‘Nothing.’ You see the headless
man could write nothing, that’s naught,
zero, or the <span class='it'>letter O</span>. Then the blind man, of
course, could read nothing; the dumb man could
repeat nothing; and the deaf man heard nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pooh! I don’t think that’s very clever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not modernly clever, but it’s a good example
of the old-time enigmas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gracious! What a lot you know about puzzles.
Have you always studied them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; I loved them as a child, and I love
them still. I think this whole book is great
fun. But we’ll strike some really difficult ones
yet. Here’s one I’ve never seen before. I’ll
read it, and see if we, either of us, get a
clue.</p>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line0'>“‘What is it men and women all despise,</p>
<p class='line0'>Yet one and all alike as highly prize?</p>
<p class='line0'>What kings possess not; yet full sure am I</p>

<p class='line0'>What never was for sale; yet any day</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” remarked Patty, complacently, as he
finished reading, “I’ve guessed that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have! You bright little thing! I
haven’t. Now, don’t tell me. Wait a
minute! No, I can’t catch it. Tell me the
answer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, it’s An Old Shoe,” said Patty, laughing.
“See how it all fits in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; it’s rattling clever. I like that one.
Did you guess it as I read?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; it seemed to dawn on me as you went
along. They often do that, if I read them
slowly. Now, here’s another old one. I’ll read,
and you guess.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line'>“‘If it be true, as Welshmen say,</p>
<p class='line'>Honour depends on pedigree,</p>
<p class='line'>Then stand by—clear the way—</p>
<p class='line'>And let me have fair play.</p>
<p class='line'>For, though you boast thro’ ages dark</p>
<p class='line'>Your pedigree from Noah’s ark,</p>
<p class='line'>I, too, was with him there.</p>
<p class='line'>For I was Adam, Adam I,</p>

<p class='line'>In spite of wind and weather;</p>

See how clever it is; if I walk, it puts an end
to me! and I die by resurrection! Oh, that’s a
good one. But you see this one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The golden head and the close-cropped dark
one bent over the book together and read these
lines:</p>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line0'>“I sit stern as a rock when I’m raising the wind,</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“Now that’s an old favourite with all puzzle-lovers,”
said Philip, as they finished reading it.
“And it has never been satisfactorily guessed.
The usual answer is The Crown of England.
But that doesn’t seem right to me. However,
I know no other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how does the Crown of England fit all
the requirements?” said Patty, looking over
the text.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, ‘this isle’ is supposed to mean Great
Britain. And I believe it is a historic fact that
the Crown spent one night in a big chest called
the Ark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was it there for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, between the two reigns of William IV.
and Victoria, there was a delay of some hours
in the night before she really received the
crown, and it was then placed in the ‘Ark.’
The weight of the crown is about three pounds,
and they say, if drawn out into gold wire, it
would stretch a mile.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would depend on the thickness of the
wire,” commented Patty, sagely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it would. I don’t like the answer, anyway.
But I can’t think of a better one. Let’s
try some easy ones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take this mathematical one, then. ‘Divide
nine into two equal parts that, added together,
will make ten.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some time Philip worked over this. He
tried arabic figures, printed words, and Roman
numerals. At last, he exclaimed, “Ah, now we
have it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you really done it?” cried Patty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Look. I write the Roman nine, IX,
you know. Then I fold the paper crosswise,
right through the middle. Now, what do you
read on this side?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“IV,” said Patty; “that’s four.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Now I turn the folded paper over, and
what do you read?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“VI; that’s six.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and six and four are ten. Though, as
you know, we divided our nine into exactly equal
parts by that crossways fold through the middle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a good one,” said Patty, with a little
sigh; “but I don’t see how you guessed it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But <span class='it'>I</span> see that you’re not to guess any more
to-night,” said Mr. Fairfield, coming into the
library, and looking at the absorbed puzzlers.
“I’m going to take you both to the dining-room,
where Mrs. Fairfield will give you a very
small bit of very light supper, and then, Mr.
Van Reypen, I shall send my daughter to her
much-needed and well-earned rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’m not a bit sleepy, father dear,” protested
Patty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No matter, my child; if you go into this
ridiculous game, you must promise me not to
overdo it. I will not allow you to work late
at night on these problems.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Daddykins, I promise. Wow! but
I’m hungry! Come on, Mr. Van Reypen, let’s
see what Nan will give us to support our famishing
frames.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the dining-room they went, and Nan’s gay
little supper soon brushed the cobwebs out of
Patty’s brain. But she was well satisfied with
her first evening of real work on her “Puzzle
Contest.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span><h1>CHAPTER III</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:0.9em;'>A LECTURE</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patricia,” said Mr. Fairfield, one
morning at the breakfast-table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty gave a great jump, clasped her
hands to her breast dramatically, and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my gracious goodness! <span class='it'>What</span> do you
call me that for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because,” went on her father, “I’m going
to lecture you, and I’m in a very serious mood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Proceed, Mr. Frederick Fairfield, Esquire;”
and Patty assumed an expression of rapt attention
and excessive meekness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, to put it in a few words, I won’t have
that young Van Reypen hanging around here so
much!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! is that all? Well, you’re barking up
the wrong tree! You should advise him of
that fact, not me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Incidentally, as I go along, consider yourself
reproved for that awful bit of slang. But
now I’m concerned with this other subject. It
won’t be necessary for me to speak to the young
man, for I’m telling you that you must discourage
his attentions somewhat. He comes too
often.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think so, too,” agreed Patty, calmly.
“But it isn’t me—I, he comes to see. It’s
Nan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Patty, how silly!” exclaimed Nan,
laughing and blushing a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it is, daddy. Nan encourages him
something scan’lous! I don’t wonder you
kick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Object, Patty, not kick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir; object is just what I mean.”
Patty’s demure air made her father laugh, but
he returned to his theme.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you know, child, I like to have you
amused and happy, and I like to have your
young friends come to see you. But this chap
has already been here three evenings this week,
and it’s only Thursday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That leaves him just three more to come,
doesn’t it?” said Patty, counting on her fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, it does not! If he keeps this up,
he’ll be forbidden the house altogether.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, what a pity! And he such a nice young
man, with rosy cheeks and curly hair! Father,
you’re cruel to your only child!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Patty, behave yourself. You’re too
young to have a man calling on you so often,
and I really object to it.”</p>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line0'>“‘I will be good, dear mother,</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>hummed Patty, “and I’ll tell you frankly, my
stern parent, that, if you’ll only let the Van
Reypen villain stay by me until I get these puzzles
done, I don’t care if I never see him again
after that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Patty,” cried Nan, “how ungrateful!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ungrateful, perhaps, to that bold, bad young
man, but obedient to my dear, kind, old
father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Patty was in this amiably foolish mood,
she was incorrigible, so Mr. Fairfield said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, my lady. Let him come a few
times to work out those pestilential puzzles, and
then I shall hold you to your promise, to cut
his acquaintance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he really as bad as all that, father?”
asked Patty, in awestruck tones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He isn’t bad at all. He’s a most estimable
and exemplary young man. But I won’t have
anybody calling on you three nights in one
week, at your age. It’s out of the question!
Kenneth doesn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Ken is so busy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it’s because he has some idea of the
proprieties.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And hasn’t Mr. Van Reypen <span class='it'>any</span> idea of the
proprieties?” Patty’s eyes opened wide at this
awful suggestion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, he has;” and Mr. Fairfield smiled in
spite of himself. “Or, he would have, if you’d
let him! It’s all your fault, Patty; you drag
him here, to mull over those idiotic questions!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I drag him here! Oh, father, what a rudeness!
Well, I simply <span class='it'>must</span> have his help on the
rest of those puzzles. How would it be if you
engaged him as my assistant, and paid him a
salary? Would that help matters?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How many of your precious puzzles are
done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sixty-nine out of the hundred.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How many have you solved yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About fifty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then that man did nineteen for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; and, if he hadn’t, I <span class='it'>never</span> could have
guessed them! Oh, he <span class='it'>is</span> clever!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And when do the answers have to be sent
in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“April first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m! an appropriate day! Well, Patty, as
your heart is so set on this thing, carry it
through; but don’t ever begin on such a task
again. Now, Mr. Van Reypen may help you,
if you wish, but I mean it when I say he must
not come here to call more than twice in one
week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” agreed Patty, cheerfully. “May
I send him some puzzles to guess, father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I won’t have you writing to him. Not
letters, I mean. But, if you can’t guess a puzzle,
you may send it to him, and I trust you
not to let this permission develop into a correspondence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir; I won’t,” said Patty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, after Mr. Fairfield had gone away, the
girl turned to Nan, with a perplexed look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whatever ails father,” she said, “to talk
to me like that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s right, Patty. You don’t see the difference,
but there is a great difference between your
friendship for Kenneth and Roger, which dates
from your schooldays, and your sudden acquaintance
with Mr. Van Reypen, who is older,
and who is a far more experienced man of the
world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Mr. Hepworth is a lot older than Mr.
Van Reypen, and nobody objects to his coming
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Hepworth is an old friend of your father’s,
and has always been in the habit of coming
here often.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, these distinctions are too much for
me,” declared Patty. “But I don’t care a snip-jack
about Philip Van Reypen, personally. If
I can just have his help on my thirty-one remaining
problems, I’ll cheerfully bid him farewell
forevermore.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no mistaking Patty’s sincerity, and
Nan felt decidedly relieved, for she and her
husband had feared that Patty was taking too
deep a personal interest in the attractive young
millionaire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, girlie. Suppose, then, you send
him two or three of your brain-rackers, and ask
him to come around, say, on Monday next.
That will convey a gentle hint not to come
sooner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a long time,” said Patty, dubiously;
“but, if I need to, I can send him more puzzles
before that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty ran away to her study, and spent the
morning working on her puzzles. It was by
no means drudgery, for she enjoyed it all. The
puzzles were of all sorts, from charades and
square words, to the most abstruse problems.
She solved several, and four she gave up as
impossible for her ever to guess. These she
concluded to send to Mr. Van Reypen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was more difficult than she anticipated,
to compose a note to go with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had no wish to disobey her father’s commands,
even in spirit, and wanted to write an
impersonal letter, such as he would approve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, for some reason, she couldn’t accomplish
it. Philip Van Reypen was himself so straightforward,
and so quick to see through any subterfuge,
that all the notes she wrote seemed to
her artificial and insincere. She tore them up
one after another, and at last, seizing her pen
again, she wrote rapidly:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Mr. Van Reypen</span>:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s no use. I’ve written a dozen notes and
torn them up, trying to imply, or hint politely,

parents think you come here too often, and, I
daresay, you think so, too. So, at their command,
you’re not to come again till next Monday.
Come at four o’clock, and <span class='it'>don’t</span> ask to
stay to dinner. I enclose some puzzles that I
hope you can solve. I can’t.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;margin-top:0.5em;'>“<span class='sc'>Patricia Fairfield</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There!” said Patty, to herself, as she read
it over, “I think that would do credit to a
‘Young Lady’s Model Letter Writer.’ It tells
the truth without subterfuge, and it certainly
does not invite the correspondence father is so
afraid of. Now, I’m not going to touch these
old puzzles again, to-day, or I’ll have brain
failure. I think I’ll go and practise some new
songs. Music hath charms to sooth a puzzled
breast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Patty warbled away for an hour or so, in
her clear, sweet voice, and Nan came down to
the music room to listen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Patty,” she said, “if you’d put half
the time and pains on your music that you do
on those foolish puzzles, you’d be a great
singer!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Think so, Nannikins? I doubt it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you would. You have a lovely voice,
but it needs more training and lots of practice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it won’t get it. Life’s too short; and,
too, nobody cares for parlour tricks of a musical
nature. I sing well enough to entertain the Fairfield
family, and that’s all I care for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty, have you no ambition?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; but my ambitions are sensible. If I
practised four hours a day, I’d still have only
a small parlour voice,—not a concert voice.
And there’d be four hours a day wasted. And
days are <span class='it'>so</span> short, anyway. I’m going to Christine’s
this afternoon; do you want the motor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes; I did expect to make some calls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, you can drop me on the way. But,
won’t it be fun, Nan, when I get my own little
runabout? I’ll be quite independent of Miller
and the big car.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t use it alone in the city.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, I could! Just to fly over to Christine’s
in the afternoon, or something like that.
Father would kick at first, but he’d soon get
used to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do wind that poor man around your
finger, Patty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good thing, too. If I didn’t, he’d wind me
around his finger. So, as it is, I have the best
of it. But I’m not at all sure I’ll catch that
runabout, after all. The first of April draweth
near, and many of those silly problems refuse
to let themselves be solved.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you will get it, after you’ve worked so
hard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope so, too. But hopes don’t solve anagrams
and enigmas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, if you don’t get it, there’s always
room for you in the big car. What time do
you want to go to Christine’s?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About four. She won’t be home till then.
Does that suit your plans?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perfectly, my child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, at four o’clock, Nan left Patty at Christine’s
new home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not a typical boarding-house, but an
apartment occupied by two elderly people, who
had a room to spare, which seemed just right
for the young art student.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even in the short time she had been there,
Christine had done much to make the plain
room more attractive. And Patty had helped,
for many of the comforts that had been added
had been her gifts. A growing palm, and a
smaller bowl of ferns looked thrifty and well-kept;
and a large jar of exquisite pink roses
gave the place a gala air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What lovely roses!” exclaimed Patty,
sniffing daintily at one of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, aren’t they?” said Christine. “Mr.
Hepworth sent them. He sends them every
week. Isn’t he kind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but no kinder than he ought to be.
Everybody ought to be good to you, Christine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, because you’re so sweet and good, yourself.
And you work so hard, and you never
complain,—and you’re so pretty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty added the last clause, because her former
words brought a pink glow to Christine’s cheeks,
and a shining light to her dark eyes, and she
looked indeed beautiful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do work hard; but, Patty, I’m winning
out! I’ve already had some illustrations accepted
by a good magazine; and I’ve orders
for two magazine covers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine! Why, Christine, you’ve arrived!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not quite that; but I’m steadily going ahead.
I say that quite without conceit. It’s simply that
I’m learning how to use the talent I have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You dear!” cried Patty. “As if any one
could imagine <span class='it'>you</span> conceited! And, of course,
you’re going ahead,—fast!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, Patty, Mrs. Van Reypen is so good to
me. I don’t understand it. Why, she fairly
showers me with kindnesses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understand it. Mrs. Van Reypen is very
eccentric. If she dislikes people, she can’t be
caustic enough to them or about them. But,
if she takes a fancy to any one, then she just
adores her. And I’m so glad she’s taken a fancy
to you,—for she surely has.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, she has. But sometimes it embarrasses
me, for she invites me to see her so often,
or to go to entertainments with her, and I <span class='it'>have</span>
to refuse, for I mustn’t neglect my work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, she understands that. You stand by
your work, and I know her well enough to know
she’ll respect and admire you all the more for
it.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span><h1>CHAPTER IV</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:0.9em;'>THE HUNDREDTH QUESTION</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the very last day of March. The
next day Patty must send in her answers
to the hundred puzzles, and she still had
four of them unsolved. She had worked on
these all day, and her brain was weary. Kenneth
came in late in the afternoon, but he
couldn’t help, as he had no knack for puzzles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t like them, Patty,” he declared.
“You see acrostics have cross words to them,
and cross words always irritate me. I like kind
words.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Ken,” said Patty, laughing; “I’ll
invent a new kind of acrostic that has only kind
words in it, some day. But can’t you help me
with this one? A train of six cars is to be
pulled up a steep incline. The engine provided
can pull only three cars. Another engine
of equal power is brought and put behind the
train, to push it up the hill. The two engines,
working together, get the train uphill. Supposing
the cars coupled with chains, are the
chains taut, or hanging loosely? I’ve puzzled
over that for hours. You see, half the weight
of the train is pulled and half is pushed, so
how do those stupid chains know whether
they’re to hang loose, or pull taut?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m,” said Kenneth, “there must be an
answer to that. Where’s your Van Reypen
satellite? Can’t he do it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You needn’t speak of Mr. Van Reypen in
that tone,” said Patty, annoyed; “he’s helped
me a lot more than you have!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, there, Patsy, don’t be an acrostic!
Don’t give cross words to your poor old chum,
who lives but for to please you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty laughed at Kenneth’s mock tragic tones,
but she went on:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do think you might do one for me, Ken.
You haven’t even tried.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, girlie; I’ll do this one about the
cars and chains. Do you mind if I go off by
myself to think it out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kenneth went into another room, and Patty
looked after him in wonderment. She didn’t
guess that he was longing to help her, and,
though he couldn’t guess conundrums, he hoped
he might puzzle out this question of mechanical
power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then Mr. Hepworth came, and also
Philip Van Reypen. They knew it was the
last day, and they wanted to hear what Patty’s
final report might be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philip Van Reypen had been greatly amused
at the letter Patty wrote him, and, being an
exceedingly sensible young man, he had not answered
or referred to it definitely, but had accepted
its dictum, and had called at the Fairfield
house far less often. Nor had he again hinted
for an invitation to dinner, but awaited one
which should be freely given.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How many yet to do?” he asked, blithely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Four,” answered Patty, disconsolately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out with ’em! What are they? Not
charades, I hope; I simply <span class='it'>can’t</span> do charades.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s one charade left, but here’s an
enigma, which is about as bad. Oh, Mr. Hepworth,
can’t <span class='it'>you</span> guess it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Appealed to thus, Hepworth made up his
mind to help, if he possibly could, and both he
and Van Reypen listened attentively as Patty
read:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘I am intangible, yet I may be felt, seen, and
heard. I exist from two to six feet above the
ground. I have neither shape nor substance,
and, though a natural production, I am neither
animal, vegetable, or mineral. I am neither
male nor female, but something between both.
I am told of in the Scriptures, in history, in
song, and in story. I am sad or merry; loving
or treacherous. I am given or bought, and, because
of my great value, I am sometimes stolen.
I am used by men who swear, and by innocent
children. Of late, there has been a prejudice
against me, but I shall probably be in vogue as
long as the world shall stand.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all thought and pondered. Nan came
in, and, as Patty read it slowly over again, even
she tried to guess it. But they could not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last Philip Van Reypen gave a whoop of
triumph, and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have it! Miss Fairfield, I’ve guessed it!
Will you give it to me, if I tell you what it
is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your speech sounds like an enigma, too,”
said Patty, a little bewildered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’ve guessed it, I tell you. And, if you’ll
promise to give it to me, I’ll tell you the
answer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I won’t promise,” said Patty. “It
might be the motor car itself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it isn’t! It’s far more valuable than
that! It’s a kiss!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” said Patty, “so it is! How <span class='it'>did</span> you
guess it? It’s fearfully hard!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Hepworth looked distinctly chagrined.
Why, he thought, couldn’t he have guessed the
foolish thing! It was easy enough,—after one
knew it!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ken, come in here!” cried Patty; “we
have guessed another! That is, Mr. Van
Reypen did. Now, there are only three
left.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only two!” announced Kenneth, as with a
beaming face he came in, bringing a dozen
sheets of paper, scrawled all over with sketches
of trains of cars going uphill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, have you done that one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; I’m sure I’m right. The three first
cars would have taut chains, being pulled by the
front engine; and the three last cars would be
pushed up close together, with their chains
hanging limp, because they are pushed by the
back engine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Ken, of course that’s right! Thank
you, heaps! Now I’ll get the other two, if I
have to sit up all night to do it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are they?” asked Mr. Hepworth,
conscious of a faint hope that he might yet be
of assistance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One’s a charade,” answered Patty. “Here
it is:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve worked on that a solid week, but I can’t
get it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Count me out, too,” said Philip Van Reypen;
“charades are too many for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll do that one for you, Patty,” said Mr.
Hepworth, quietly. “Give me a copy to take
home with me, and I’ll send you the answer
to-night, or early in the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless you, my angel!” cried Patty. “Will
you, really? Why, Mr. Hepworth, I didn’t
know you <span class='it'>could</span> guess charades.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t!” said he, a little grimly; “but I’m
going to, all the same. Good-bye, for now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, with a do-or-die expression, Mr. Hepworth
took leave of the group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor man!” said Nan, “he can’t guess it.
He just wants to help you out, Patty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Patty smiled and shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, nay, Nan,” she said; “if Mr. Hepworth
says he’ll guess that thing, he will! It’s
as good as done!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What faith!” murmured Van Reypen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed!” declared Patty. “Why, if
I lost faith in Mr. Hepworth, I’d lose faith
in the,—in the,—universe! I’ve known him for
years, and he <span class='it'>never</span> fails me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guessed one!” said Kenneth, proudly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You did,” returned Patty, smiling on him;
“and just for that I’m going to take you a
whole block in my motor car!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! how lovely. But, first, catch your car.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, what’s the only one left?” asked
Philip, who wanted to distinguish himself again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, just a simple conundrum,” said Patty.
“What is lower with a head on it than without
one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That sounds simple, but it isn’t easy,” said
Philip, after a few moments’ thoughts. “Nails,—pins,—cabbage
heads,—nothing seems to be
the right idea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, try as they would, they couldn’t think of
anything that led to the right answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys went home, declaring they’d think
it up, and Patty mulled it over in her mind all
the evening, without result.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she went to bed, declaring she’d dream
of the answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning she overslept, and Nan,
fearing she would be late with her list of answers,
went to waken her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wake up, you little April Fool,” she cried,
gently pulling Patty’s gold curls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Nan! is it morning? I’m so sleepy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you must wake up! It’s the First of
April, and you must win that motor car to-day
or never!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty raised her head, and then dropped it
back on the pillow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t get my head up,” she said; “it’s
too heavy. I guess I’ll give up the motor car.
I’d rather keep my head on the pillow. Oh,
Nan!” and suddenly Patty sprang up, with a
wild yell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it! I’ve got it! Hurrah!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mercy, Patty, do keep quiet. <span class='it'>What’s</span> the
matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, that’s it! the last puzzle! What is
lower with a head on it than without one?
Answer: a Pillow! See?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty, you’re crazy! I suppose that is the
answer, but <span class='it'>I</span> think it’s silly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it isn’t; not as puzzles go! Oh, Nan,
now I have them all!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not the one Mr. Hepworth took away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll get it back in time. You see if he
doesn’t! Oh, Nan, Hooray with me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t. You’ve made noise enough to
frighten the whole block now! Do quiet down,
Patty, and get dressed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, I will,” said Patty, in a whisper,
and Nan went away, laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty went down to breakfast in a very
happy frame of mind, and announced to her
father that the motor car was as good as
won.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you feel so sure of Mr. Hepworth’s
puzzle?” asked her father, a little curiously.
“He never solved a charade before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It doesn’t matter,” said Patty, with supreme
confidence. “He said he’d do it. If he hadn’t
<span class='it'>known</span> he could do it, he wouldn’t have said he
<span class='it'>would</span> do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, stop, Patty!” cried Nan. “You talk
like a puzzle, yourself. Don’t get the habit,
I beg.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t. But now I must go and copy my
answers neatly, and by that time Mr. Hepworth’s
will be here, and I’ll send ’em off about
noon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty spent a happy morning copying her answers
in her neat script, and looking with pride
at her complete list.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last it was all done, and she had left a
vacant space to insert the answer to the charade
when Mr. Hepworth should send it. But at
noon it had not arrived, and she had had no
word from him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Telephone, and ask him about it,” suggested
Nan, as they sat at luncheon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Patty, “he said he’d send it, and
I’ll wait for him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long can you wait?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, the only stipulation is that the list
of answers shall be postmarked not later than
April first; but I hate to wait till the last mail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So should I; do telephone, Patty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not yet. He’ll send it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The afternoon dragged by, with no word from
Mr. Hepworth. At four o’clock, Nan went
to Patty’s room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dearie,” she said, “don’t lose your whole
effort by a bit of stubbornness. Mr. Hepworth
must have forgotten to send his answer—or,
perhaps, he sent it by a messenger, and it went
to the wrong place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He wouldn’t do that,” said Patty, shaking
her head. “He’ll guess it, and, as soon as he
does, he’ll telephone me. I know him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know him, too, and I know his faithfulness.
But mistakes do happen sometimes. If
you’d only telephone,—or let me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Nannie,” said Patty, gently. “This is
my picnic, and I shall conduct it in my own
way. And I won’t telephone Mr. Hepworth, if
I have to send the answers with one missing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then the telephone bell rang!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it was Mr. Hepworth calling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve guessed it!” he said, breathlessly, but
triumphant. “But it’s rather complicated, and
I can’t explain it very well over the telephone.
I’ll come right over. Is there time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” returned Patty; “come on. Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She hung up the receiver, and turned to Nan
with an “I told you so” expression on her
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it was a narrow escape,” said Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all,” said Patty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Mr. Hepworth came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked calm and smiling as ever, and
showed no trace of his sleepless night and
anxious hard-working day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s ‘Forceps,’” he said, as soon as he had
greeted them; “but it isn’t a fair charade at all.
A charade should be divided into its two or
more legitimate syllables. But this one is divided
‘Force’ and ‘P.S.’ You see, the P.S. is
referred to as the principal part of a lady’s
letter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that old joke!” cried Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. But, if it hadn’t been for that old
joke, I never could have guessed it. For that
was what put me on the right track. But the
whole charade is distinctly unfair in its construction.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think so, too,” said Patty, who had been
looking it over. “Oh! Mr. Hepworth, how did
you ever guess it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told you I would,” he answered, simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; and so I knew you would,” she returned,
with a glance as straightforward as his
own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, I’ll add it to my list,” she went on,
“and then we’ll go out to the box together,
to mail it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a moment, Patty was ready, with the big,
fat envelope, clearly addressed and much bestamped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Throwing a light wrap round her, she went
with Mr. Hepworth the half-block to the lamp-post
letter-box. But the large envelope would
not go in the box.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind, Patty,” he said; “I’ll take it
to the post-office for you. That will be better,
anyway, as it may be postmarked a little sooner.
And it’s my fault that it’s delayed so late, anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not!” exclaimed Patty. “If it
hadn’t been for you, I couldn’t have sent
the list at all! I mean, not a complete
list.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Van Reypen helped you far more than I
did,” said Mr. Hepworth, a little bitterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty noticed his tone, and, with her ready
tact, she ignored it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Van Reypen did help me,” she said;
“but, with all his help, the list would not have
been perfect but for you. I thank you, very
much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty held out her hand, and Hepworth took
it slowly, almost reverently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty,” he said, “I wonder if you know how
much I would do for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much?” said Patty, not really thinking
of what she was saying, for her mind was
still on her puzzles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I tell you?” and the intense note in
his voice brought her back to a realising sense
of the situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not now,” she cried, gaily; “you promised
to get those answers to the post-office in double-quick
time. That would be the nicest thing you
could do for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’ll do it, you little witch;” and, with
a quick bow, Hepworth turned and strode down
the street.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:0.9em;'>A SUMMER HOME</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I were sure Patty would get her motor
car,” said Nan, “I’d vote for the seashore.
But, if she doesn’t, I’d rather
go to the mountains.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“’Course I’ll get it,” declared Patty. “I’m
sure, certain, positive, convinced, satisfied beyond
all shadow of doubt that I’ve cinched that
car! It only remains to get the formal notice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And to get the car,” added her father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were discussing, in family conclave, their
plans for the coming summer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty liked the seashore, and Nan, the mountains,
but each wanted the other to be pleased,
so there was a generous rivalry going on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I can use it in the mountains,” went on
Patty; “mountain roads are pretty much civilised
nowadays. And, anyway, it’s sure to be
a perfect hill-climber.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, <span class='it'>sure</span> to be!” said Mr. Fairfield, who
never could bring himself to believe seriously
that Patty would get the car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, let’s divide the time,” suggested Nan.
“Let’s go to the seashore first, and spend, say,
May, June, and July. Then go to the mountains
for August and September.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That would be lovely!” declared Patty, enthusiastically,
“if I didn’t know you were planning
it that way for my benefit. And I can’t—no,
I can<span class='it'>not</span> bring myself to accept such a
sackerry-fice!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t help yourself, you mean,” said
Nan. “And, now that part of it’s settled, where
shall we go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like the New Jersey shore,” said Mr. Fairfield,
“because I can run up to New York so
easily from there. But I was thinking of buying
a house, so we could go to it each summer,
and so do away with this yearly discussion
of where to go. Even if we have a summer
home, we can go on a trip to the mountains as
well, later in the season.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s so,” agreed Nan. “No one wants
to go to the mountains before August.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, won’t it be gay!” cried Patty. “A
home of our own, at the seashore! With little
white curtains blowing out of its windows,
and box trees at the entrance to the drive!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That sounds attractive,” agreed Nan.
“And wide verandas all round, and the ocean
dashing over them, sometimes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wouldn’t be a bad investment,” said Mr.
Fairfield. “We wouldn’t build, you know, but
buy a house, and then fix it up to suit ourselves.
And, whenever we tired of it, we could sell
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good business, Mr. Fairfield,” said Patty,
nodding her head at him approvingly. “Now,
I know the spot I’d like best. And that’s at
Spring Beach. It’s the prettiest part of the
whole Jersey coast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think so, too,” said Nan. “It’s not a
large enough place to be rackety and noisy, but
it has beautiful homes and charming people.
I’ve been there several times, though not to stay
long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be sure to buy a house with a garage, father,”
put in Patty. “For I must have a place
to keep my car.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, as we’ll have our own car there, I
fancy we’ll have a garage, Puss. But we may
have to add an ell, to accommodate your toy
wagon. When do you expect to get it, by the
way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The winner will be announced on the twentieth
of April, and the car delivered about May
first. So I’ll take you both for a May-day ride.
Not both at once, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll take Miller on your first few rides,
my girl; until you’ve thoroughly learned how
to manage the thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, I will. For I don’t want to make
any stupid mistakes through ignorance. Accidents
may happen, but, if so, I expect to be able
to use my skill and knowledge to repair them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty, you have a sublime self-confidence,”
said her father, laughing; “but I’m glad of
it. For it will probably carry you through
when your vaunted skill and knowledge give
out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few nights later, Mr. Fairfield came home
with several photographs of Spring Beach
houses that were for sale. Each was accompanied
with a description, and the Fairfield trio
looked them over with great interest. Two
seemed more desirable than the rest, and it was
decided that, next day, they should all go down
to the shore to look at them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s take Christine,” suggested Patty; “a
day at the seashore will do her good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, next morning, the quartette started for
Spring Beach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christine had never seen the ocean before, and
Patty greatly enjoyed seeing the Southern girl’s
delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a fine April day, the air clear and cool,
and the blue sky cloudless, save for some cotton-wool
masses near the horizon. The waves were
deep, translucent blue, with brilliantly white
crests, and they rolled and tumbled in to shore,
as if anxious to greet Christine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it like you thought it would be?” asked
Patty, as Christine stood, with clasped hands,
gazing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; in its lines. For, of course, I’ve seen
pictures of it. But I didn’t know it was so
<span class='it'>alive</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Patty, with a nod of comprehension,
“that’s the way it seems to me. Really
alive, and always responsive to my moods and
thoughts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t know you had moods and thoughts,”
said Christine, smiling at Patty a little quizzically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“’Deed I have! Perhaps not such subtle and
temperamental ones as yours or Mr. Hepworth’s,
but perfectly good moods and thoughts,
all the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you class mine with Mr. Hepworth’s?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because you’re both artists. Aren’t artists
supposed to have most impressive and unspeakable
thoughts at sight of the ocean or the moon
or the purple shadows on the distant hills?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty, I suppose you’re making fun of me,
but I don’t mind a bit. And, of one thing I’m
sure, whatever your thoughts may be, they’re
never unspeakable!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right you are, Christine! I’m glad you
appreciate my talent for volubility! That’s
why I like the sea. I can talk to it all day,
and it is most appreciative, but it never talks
back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it talks back to me! It has told me lots
of things already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s because you’re an artist. But this
must be the new house! Father’s turning in
here. Oh, isn’t it lovely!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a most beautiful place, though its somewhat
dense shrubbery partly hid the view of the
ocean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the house was delightful. Large, roomy,
and well-built, it seemed all any one could desire
for a summer home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went through it, with many comments,
and then went on a block farther, to look at the
other one they had in mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was equally desirable, in every way, as a
dwelling, but the large grounds had very few
trees or tall shrubs, so that the sea-view was
unobstructed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is my choose!” declared Patty, sitting
down on the steps of the front veranda.
“What’s the use of coming to the seashore and
living in a forest? Oh, my fond parents, do
decide to take this one, for your little Patty’s
sake!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will there be shade enough?” asked Mr.
Fairfield.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed!” declared Patty. “If not, we
can go inside and draw the curtains. But I do
love a house where you can see out. And I
think this is the finest ocean view on the beach.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is,” corroborated the agent, who was
showing them the house. “And the sunrise
view is grand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t often see the sun rise,” admitted
Patty, laughing; “but perhaps I shall, down
here, for I’m going to sleep out of doors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In your motor car?” enquired her father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir! I’m going to have a veranda bedroom.
There, you see it, between those two
front towers. I’ve always wanted to try that
sort of a fresh-air fund scheme.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, whatever you and Nan decide on, I’ll
agree to,” said Mr. Fairfield, who lived but to
please his wife and daughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, after some further serious consideration
of rooms and outlooks, Nan and Patty agreed
that the second house they had visited was the
one for them, and Christine commended their
choice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s rather large for just us three,” said
Nan, but Patty replied: “Never mind, we’ll
have lots of company. I expect to have
house parties a great deal of the time;
we’ve never had room for much company
in New York. What shall we name the
place?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Sea View,’” said her father, and Patty
laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said; “or ‘Ocean View,’ or ‘Fair
View,’ or ‘Beach View’! No, let’s get something
descriptive and unhackneyed. Help us,
Christine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like a name like ‘The Breakers,’” said
Nan. “It’s so dignified.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How about ‘The Pebbles’?” asked Christine,
looking at the pebbled walks that led
through the lawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just right!” said Patty, “and it’s
seashorey, too. We’ll call the place ‘The Pebbles’;
shall us, Nan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; I like that. It’s simple and yet expressive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now,” said Mr. Fairfield, “let us go
over to the hotel for luncheon, and then, while
I have a little business talk with the agent, you
ladies can rave over the sea, the sea, the open
sea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What good times you do have, don’t you,
Patty?” said Christine, as they strolled along
the board walk to the hotel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Christine, I do. And I often feel as
if I didn’t deserve so much happiness; and perhaps
it’s wrong for me to have so much, when
many other girls have so little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Patty; that isn’t the way to look at it.
You ought to be glad and thankful, but never
feel any doubt about its being all right. Myself,
I have so much to be thankful for, sometimes
my heart almost bursts with gratitude.
But I know it’s all right, and that I <span class='it'>ought</span> to
have it. Whatever is, is right, Patty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; I s’pose so. But, Christine, what do
you mean, about yourself? Are you glad you
have to earn your own living?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’s merely incidental. Since I have
to earn my own living, I’m glad I can, of course.
Or, at least, I shall soon be able to. But I
mean, I’m so glad that I have such talent as I
have, and such a love of my life work, and
such dear friends, and such a happy outlook
generally.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Christine, you’re a darling. I don’t believe
many people know how fine and lovely you are.
Do they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know many people,” said Christine,
smiling; “but those I do know don’t all share
your views. Elise doesn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bother Elise! Don’t let her bother you!
Why think of her at all? Christine, if your
philosophy of happiness is any good, it ought
to teach you to cut out anything unpleasant.
And, if Elise is unpleasant, cut her out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, girlie; not that. If Elise is unpleasant,—and
it may be only my imagination,—I shall
try to make her become pleasant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you joy of your task,” said Patty,
grinning, for she knew Elise better than Christine
did, and, while she liked her herself, she
felt sure her two friends could never be very
congenial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The well-selected and well-served luncheon
proved most acceptable to appetites sharpened
by sea air, and, during its course, enthusiastic
plans were made for improving and furnishing
“The Pebbles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Christine will help us with the ‘artistic values,’—I
think that’s what you call ’em,” said
Patty. “Nan can look after chairs and tables
and such prosaic things; and I’ll sew the curtains
and sofa-cushions. I love to make soft,
silky, frilly things,—and I’m just going to have
fun with this house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s my part in this universal plan?”
asked Mr. Fairfield.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you can just pay the bills, and say ‘perfectly
lovely, my dear,’ whenever we ask you
how you like anything!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As this was just the rôle Mr. Fairfield had laid
out for himself, he acquiesced graciously, and
then, luncheon being over, they all went back
to the house again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll have to come down several times,”
said Nan, “but we may as well measure for
some of the hangings and rugs now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Mr. Fairfield filled many pages of his
memorandum book with notes and measurements,
and, after an hour or so, they all felt
they had made quite a beginning on the furnishing
of the new house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One delightful room, with a full sea view,
Patty declared was Christine’s room, and she
was to occupy it just whenever she chose, and
she was to select its furnishings herself. The
girl’s eyes filled with tears at this new proof
of loving friendship, and, though she knew she
should take but few vacation days from her
work that summer, yet she willingly consented
to select the fittings, on condition that it be
used as a guest room when she was not present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty’s own rooms were delightful. A bedroom
and dressing-room, opening on a half-enclosed
balcony, gave her the opportunity for
sleeping out of doors that she so much desired.
Her father insisted that she should have
what he called a “civilised bedchamber,” and
then, if she chose to play gipsy occasionally,
she might do so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So she and Christine planned all her furniture
and decorations, and made notes and lists, and,
before they knew it, it was time to return to
New York.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know a lot about house decoration,
Christine; don’t you?” said Patty, as they sat
in the homeward-bound train.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not a lot. But it comes natural to me
to know what things harmonise in a household.
Of course, I’ve never studied it,—it’s a science;
now, you know. But, if I didn’t want to take
up illustrating seriously, I would try decorating.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, illustrating is lots nicer,—and it pays
better, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know about that. But Mr. Hepworth
says I will make a name for myself as an
illustrator, and so I know I shall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty laughed. “You have as much faith in
that man as I have,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; I’ve implicit faith in his judgment, and
in his technical knowledge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ve faith in him in every way. I
think he’s a fine character.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ought to think so, Patty. Why, he worships
the ground you walk on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Christine, what nonsense!” Patty
blushed rosy-red, but tried to laugh it off.
“Why, he’s old enough to be my father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, he isn’t. He’s thirty-five,—that’s a lot
older than you,—but, all the same, he adores
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you wouldn’t talk like that, Christine,”
said Patty, with a new note of hauteur in
her voice. “Mr. Hepworth is my very good
friend, and I look up to him in every way, but
there is no affection or any such foolishness between
us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not on your side, perhaps; but there is on
his.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if you think so, I don’t want to hear
about it. When you talk like that, it just goes
to spoil the nice pleasant friendship that Mr.
Hepworth and I have had for years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t the same as you have for Roger Farrington
and Kenneth Harper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is! Just the same. Except that Mr. Hepworth
is so much older that I never call him
by his first name. The others were my school
chums. Look here, Christine, we’re going to
be very good friends, you and I,—but, if you
talk to me like that about Mr. Hepworth, you’ll
queer our friendship at its very beginning. Now,
quit it,—will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I will, Patty. And I didn’t mean any
harm. I only wanted you to know Mr. Hepworth’s
attitude toward you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, when I want to know it, I’ll discover it
for myself, or let him tell me. You must know,
Christine, that I’m not bothering about such
things. I don’t want affection, as you call it,
from any man. I like my boy friends, or my
men friends, but there’s no sentiment or sentimentality
between me and any one of them?
Are you on?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On what?” asked Christine, a little bewildered
at Patty’s emphatic speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On deck,” said Patty, laughing at Christine’s
blank expression and changing the subject with
promptness and dexterity.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span><h1>CHAPTER VI</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:0.9em;'>THE AWARD</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty was in high spirits. It was the
twentieth of April, and it was almost
time for the postman to call on his afternoon
round. The two Farringtons and Kenneth
were present, and all eagerly awaited the
expected letter, telling the result of the Prize
Contest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just think,” said Patty, “how many anxious
hearts all over this broad land are even now
waiting for the postman, and every one is to
be disappointed, except me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe you enjoy their disappointment,”
said Elise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know better, my child. You know I
<span class='it'>hate</span> to have people disappointed. But, in this
case, only one can win. I’m glad I’m that one,
and I’m sorry for the others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“S’pose you don’t win,” observed Roger;
“what will you do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no use s’posin’ that, for it can’t happen,”
declared Patty, turning from the window,
where she had been flattening her nose against
the glass, in a frantic endeavour to catch a first
glimpse of the belated postman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, just for fun,” urged Kenneth, “just for
argument’s sake, if you didn’t get that prize,
what would you do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t do anything. I’d know the company
that offered it was a fake, and had gone
back on its own promise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty, you’re incorrigible!” said Ken. “I
give you up. You’re the most self-assured, self-reliant,
cocksure young person I ever saw.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, sir, for them kind words! Oh!
sit still, my heart! <span class='it'>Do</span> I hear that familiar
whistle at last?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do!” shouted Kenneth, making a spring
for the front door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all followed, but Kenneth first reached
it, and fairly grabbed the letters from the astonished
letter-carrier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Returning to the library with his booty, he
ran them over slowly and tantalisingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One for Mrs. Fairfield,” he said. “From a
fashionable tailor. Do you suppose it’s a dun?
Or, perhaps, merely an announcement of new
spring furbelows. Next, one for Mr. Fairfield.
Unmistakably a circular! No good!
Ha! another for Mrs. Fairfield. Now,
this——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Ken, stop!” begged Patty. “Have
pity on me! Is there one for me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes, child. I didn’t know you wanted
it. Yes, here’s one for you. It is postmarked
‘Vernondale.’ Take it, dear one!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense, Ken. Not that one! But isn’t
there one from the Rhodes and Geer Motor
Company?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes; since you mention it, I notice there
is such a one! Do you want it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kenneth held it high above Patty’s head, but
she sprang and caught it, and waved it triumphantly
in the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told you so!” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you haven’t opened it yet,” said
Elise. “Maybe it only tells you you’ve
failed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush, hush, little one!” said Patty. “I’ll
show it to you in a minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accepting the letter-opener Kenneth proffered,
she cut open the envelope, and read the few
lines on the typewritten sheet enclosed. She
read them again, and then slowly refolded the
sheet and returned it to its envelope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After all,” she said, calmly, “it is well to
be of a philosophical nature in a time of disappointment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Patty, you didn’t win!” cried Kenneth,
springing to her side, and grasping her
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I haven’t won,” said Patty, with a heart-rending
sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you were terribly positive,” said
Elise, not very kindly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was,” sighed Patty. “I was terribly positive.
I am, still!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you talking about, Patty?” said
Roger, who began to think she was fooling
them. “Let me see that letter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take it!” said Patty, holding it out with a
despairing gesture. “Read it aloud, and let
them all know the worst!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Roger read the few lines, which were to the
effect that, owing to the unexpected number of
answers received, the decision must be delayed
until May first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Patty!” exclaimed Kenneth, greatly relieved.
“How you scared me! Of course
you’ll get it yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I shall,” said Patty, serenely, “but
I hate to wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since it was not failure, after all, the young
people felt greatly relieved, and congratulated
Patty upon her narrow escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the situation is too dramatic for my
nerves,” declared Kenneth. “When the real
letter comes, I prefer not to be here. I can’t
stand such harrowing scenes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It won’t be harrowing when the real letter
comes,” said Patty. “It will be just one grand,
triumphant jubilee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, jubilees are nerve-racking,” said Kenneth.
“I think I’ll stay away until the shouting
is over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t,” said Patty, saucily. “You’ll be
the first one here, the day the letter is due.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I suppose so! Curiosity has always been
my besetting sin. But to-day’s entertainment
seems to be over, so I may as well go
home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Us, too,” said Roger. “Come on, Elise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So good-byes were said, and Patty’s friends
went laughing away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Patty took up the letter and read it
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten days to wait,” she said, to herself.
“And suppose I shouldn’t get it, after all? But
I will,—I know I will. Something inside my
brain makes me feel sure of it. And, when I
have that sort of sureness, it never goes back
on me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went upstairs, singing merrily, and without
a shadow of doubt in her mind as to her
success in the contest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ten days passed quickly, for Patty was so
absorbed in the furnishings for the new summer
home that she was occupied every moment from
morning till night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went with Nan to all sorts of fascinating
shops, where they selected wall-papers, rugs,
furniture, and curtains. Not much bric-a-brac,
and very few pictures, for they were keeping the
house simple in tone, but comfortable and cheerful
of atmosphere. Christine gladly gave her
advice when needed, but she was very busy with
her work, and they interrupted her as seldom
as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty bought lovely things for her own
rooms,—chairs of blue and white wicker; curtains
of loose-meshed, blue silky stuff, over ruffled
dimity ones; a regulation brass bedstead
for her bedroom, but a couch that opened into
a bed for her out-of-door dormitory. By day,
this could be a chintz-covered couch with chintz
pillows; by night, a dainty, white nest of downy
comfort. Several times they went down to
Spring Beach, to inspect the work going on
there, and always returned with satisfactory
reports.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the time of departure drew near, Elise began
to realise how much she would miss Patty,
and lamented accordingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you might have arranged to go where
we’re going,” she said. “You know you could
make your people go wherever you wanted to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you go to the Adirondacks, Elise; I
couldn’t run my motor car much up there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that motor car! Even if you do get
it, Patty, you won’t use it more than a few times.
Nobody does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“P’raps not. But, somehow, it just seems to
me I shall. It just <span class='it'>seems</span> to me so. But, Elise,
you’ll come down to visit me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; for a few days. But you’ll have Christine
there most of the time, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll have Christine whenever she’ll come,”
said Patty, a little sharply; “and, Elise, if you
care anything for my friendship, I wish you’d
show a little more friendliness toward her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes; just because Mr. Hepworth thinks
she’s a prodigy, and Mrs. Van Reypen has taken
her up socially, you think she’s something
great!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty looked at Elise a moment in astonishment
at this outburst, and then she broke into a
hearty laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you’re something great, Elise! I
think you’re a great goose! What kind of talk
are you talking? Christine is a dear, sweet,
brave girl,—and you know it. Now, drop it,
and never, never, never talk like that again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elise was a little ashamed of her unjust speech,
and only too glad to turn it off by joining in
Patty’s laughter. So she only said, “Oh, Christine’s
all right!” and dropped the subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the first of May, everything was ready for
occupancy at “The Pebbles.” The lawn and
grounds were in fine condition, and the house
in perfect order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Patty begged that they shouldn’t start until
she had received word about her prize car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Puss, all the mail will be forwarded,”
said her father. “You’ll get your precious missive
there just as well as here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know that, daddy dear,—but, well,—I
can’t seem to feel like going, until I know that
car is my very own. Just wait until the third
of May, can’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was so persuasive that Nan went over to
her side, and then, of course, Mr. Fairfield had
to give his consent to wait. Not that he cared,
particularly, but he was a little afraid that
Patty would not get the prize, and thought she
might bear her disappointment better if away
from her young friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they waited, and again the group of those
most interested gathered in the Fairfield library
to await the letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christine and Mr. Hepworth were there, too,
this time; also Philip Van Reypen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. and Mrs. Fairfield, though outwardly
calm and even gay, were perhaps the most
anxious of all, for they knew how keenly a disappointment
would affect Patty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whistle sounded. The postman’s step was
heard. Instead of rushing to the door, Patty
felt a strange inertia, and sank back in her
chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go, Ken,” she said, faintly, and Kenneth
went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silently he took the mail from the carrier, silently
he returned with it to the library. There
was none of the gay chaffing they had had before,
and all because Patty, the moving spirit,
was grave and quiet, with a scared, drawn look
on her sweet face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hastily running over the letters, Kenneth laid
aside all but one, and slowly extended that to
Patty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took it, opened it, and read it with a dazed
expression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eager ones circled round, with faces tense
and waiting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Patty read her letter. Then, still with
that dazed look on her face, she glanced from
one to another. As her eyes met Mr. Hepworth’s,
she suddenly held the paper out to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve won,” she said, simply, and gave him
the letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she drew a short little sigh, almost a sob
of relief, and then the colour came back to her
face, the light to her eyes, and she smiled
naturally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve won!” she cried again. “It’s all
right!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there was jubilation, indeed! Everybody
congratulated everybody else. Everybody
had to read the wonderful letter, and see for
himself that the prize, the Electric Runabout,
had indeed been awarded to Miss Patricia Fairfield,
for the best and most complete list of answers
to the puzzles in the contest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only the girls’ parents and Gilbert Hepworth
knew how tightly the tension of Patty’s nerves
had been strained, but they had been alertly
watching for any sign of collapse, and were
thankful and relieved that the danger was over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hepworth didn’t stop then to wonder why
Patty had handed him the letter first. And, indeed,
she didn’t know herself. But she felt his
sensitive sympathy so keenly, and saw such deep
anxiety in his eyes, that involuntarily she turned
to him in her moment of triumph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told you so!” Philip Van Reypen was
shouting. “I knew we’d win! Hepworth, old
man, you did it, with that last charade! Bully
for you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, he did!” cried Patty, holding out her
hand to Mr. Hepworth, with a smile of gratitude;
“but you all helped me. Oh, isn’t it
splendid! I didn’t so much care for the car, but
I wanted to <span class='it'>win</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, <span class='it'>listen</span> to that!” exclaimed Kenneth.
“She didn’t care for the car! Oh, Patty, what
<span class='it'>are</span> you saying? Give me the car, then!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, of course I want the car, you goose! But
I mean I really cared more for the <span class='it'>game</span>,—the
winning of it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you did!” declared Van Reypen.
“That’s the true sportsman spirit: ‘not the
quarry, but the chase!’ I’m proud of you,
Miss Fairfield! Your sentiments are the
right sort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty smiled and dimpled, quite her roguish
self again, now that the exciting crisis was past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nan,” she cried, “we must celebrate! Will
you invite all this hilarious populace to dinner,
or give them an impromptu tea-fight right
now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dinner!” cried Philip Van Reypen; and
“Dinner!” took up the other voices, in gay
insistence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” said Nan; “but, if it’s to be dinner,
you must all run away now and come back
later. I can’t order a celebration dinner at a
moment’s notice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, we will.” And obediently the
guests went away, to return later for a gala
dinner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And a real celebration it was. Mr. Fairfield
himself went out to the florist’s and returned
with a centrepiece for the table, consisting of
a wicker automobile filled with flowers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By dint of much telephoning, Nan provided
place cards and favours of little motor cars;
and the ices were shaped like tiny automobiles;
and the cakes like tires. And all the viands
were so delicious, and the guests so gay and
merry, that the feast was one long to be remembered
by all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When will you get the car, Patty?” asked
Elise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know exactly. In a fortnight, perhaps.
But we’ll be down at Spring Beach then,
so whoever wants a ride in it will have to come
down there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want a ride in it,” said Philip Van Reypen,
“and I will come down there. May I ask
you to set the date?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll get a notification in due season,” said
Patty, smiling at the eager youth. “I’m not
sure it’s your turn first. No, Elise must be
first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I didn’t help you at all,” said Elise,
greatly pleased, however, at Patty’s remark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but you’re my lady friend, and so you
come first. Perhaps your brother will come
with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Perhaps</span> he <span class='it'>will</span>!” said Roger, with emphasis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And who comes next?” asked Kenneth, with
great interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Christine, of course,” said Patty, smiling at
the Southern girl, who was enjoying all the fun,
though quiet herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just as I guessed,” said Kenneth. “And,
<span class='it'>then</span>, who next? Don’t keep me in suspense!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Owing to the unexpected number of applicants,
decision is delayed for ten days,” said
Patty, laughing at Ken’s disappointed face.
“We’ll let you know when you’re due, Ken.
Don’t you worry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Need <span class='it'>I</span> worry?” asked Van Reypen, and
then Hepworth said, “Need I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you needn’t any of you worry. But
I’m not going to take anybody riding until I
learn how to manage the frisky steed myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I can show you,” said Philip, insinuatingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So can I,” said Roger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you can’t,” said Patty. “Miller is going
to teach me, and then,—well, then, we’ll see
about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, with this somewhat unsatisfactory invitation
to “The Pebbles,” they were forced to be
content.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After dinner, Kenneth remarked that it looked
like a shower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?” asked Patty. “It’s a
still, clear night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You come here, and I’ll show you,” said
Kenneth, mysteriously. Then, taking Patty’s
hand, he led her to a large davenport sofa, and
seated her in the centre of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” he said, “let it shower!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As if by magic, a half a dozen or more parcels
of all shapes and sizes fell into Patty’s lap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a shower, for you!” explained Elise,
dancing about in glee. “Open them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I see,” said Patty. “How gorgeous!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The parcels were in tissue paper, ribbon-tied,
and Patty was not long in exposing their contents.
One and all, they were gifts selected
with reference to her new motor car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elise gave her a most fetching blue silk hood,
with quaint shirring, and draw-strings, and wide
blue ribbon ties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christine gave her a lovely motor-veil, of the
newest style and flimsiest material.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roger gave her gauntleted motor-gloves, of
new and correct make.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kenneth gave a motor-clock, of the most approved
sort; and Philip Van Reypen presented
a clever little “vanity case,” which shut up into
small compass, but held many dainty toilette
accessories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Hepworth’s gift was an exquisite flower
vase, of gold and glass, to be attached to her
new car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty was more than surprised; she was almost
overcome by this “shower” of gifts, and
she exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are the <span class='it'>dearest</span> people! And you
needn’t wait for invitations. Come down to
‘The Pebbles’ whenever you want to, and I’ll
take you all riding at once! I don’t see where
you ever found such beautiful things! Nor
<span class='it'>why</span> you gave them to me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because we love you, Patty dear,” said Christine,
so softly that she thought no one heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Kenneth heard, and he smiled as he looked
at Patty, and said, “Yes, that’s why.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:0.9em;'>A NEIGHBOUR</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two days later the Fairfields went down
to Spring Beach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The intervening day was a busy one.
Mr. Fairfield went with Patty to select her
motor car, for some details of equipment and
upholstery were left to her choice. As the car
had been built especially for the Prize Contest,
it was a beautiful specimen of the finisher’s art.
It was a Stanhope, of graceful design and fine
lines. The body was Royal Blue, with cushions
of broadcloth of the same colour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty was informed she could have any other
colour if she wished, but she said the blue suited
her best.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a top which could be put up or
down at will, wide skirt-protecting mudguards,
and a full equipment of all necessary paraphernalia,
such as storm-apron, odometer, and a complete
set of tools.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty had carried with her her flower vase
and clock, and the man in charge agreed to have
them fastened in place. The flower vase, he
said, was unusual on a Stanhope, but, when
Patty said it <span class='it'>must</span> be attached somewhere, he
promised to have it done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The steering gear was a bar, fitted with a hand
grip, and both this and the controller were exceedingly
simple and easily operated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The demonstrator offered to give Patty a driving
lesson then and there, but Mr. Fairfield preferred
that she should be taught by himself, or
his experienced chauffeur, the trusty Miller.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, the men in charge of the salesroom
where the car was on exhibition were greatly
interested in seeing Patty, because she was the
winner of the contest. One young man stepped
forward with a camera, and asked the privilege
of taking a picture of Patty seated in her
own car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this Mr. Fairfield would not allow, and,
after making the necessary arrangements about
shipping the motor to Spring Beach, he took
Patty away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it fun, father?” she exclaimed, as she
went off with him, her hands full of descriptive
catalogues and circulars, telling of the marvellous
superiority of the Rhodes and Geer cars
over all competitors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s lots more interesting than if you had just
bought a car and given it to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And lots less expensive, too,” said Mr. Fairfield,
smiling. “Why, Patty, girl, that whole
affair, as it stands, is worth nearly three thousand
dollars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Goodness gracious! Is it really? I had no
idea they were so expensive! Why, your big
car didn’t cost much more than that, did it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, you see, this Stanhope of yours is a special
car, in every way, and all its fittings and accessories
are of the most up-to-date and extravagant
type. You must do all you can for
the company, by praising it to your friends. I
don’t think you can do any more than that to
further their interests.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t feel under any obligation to the
company. It was a business enterprise on their
part. They offered a prize and I won it. Now
we’re quits. Of course, I shall praise the car
to my friends, but only because it’s such a
beauty, and not because I feel that I owe anything
to the company.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are rather a logical young woman, after
all, Patty. Sometimes you seem a feather-headed
butterfly, and then again you appear to
have sound sense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A ‘feather-headed butterfly’ sounds pretty,
I think. I guess I’ll be that, mostly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t have to try very hard,” remarked
her father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But sometimes I have spells of being very
serious: for instance, wasn’t I serious when I
tried so hard to earn fifteen dollars in one
week?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, serious enough; but it was largely your
stubborn determination to succeed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that’s a good trait to have, then. It’s
what Mr. Hepworth calls steadfastness of purpose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; they’re about the same thing. And I’m
glad you have it; it’s what won the car for
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That, and my helpful friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, the helpful friends were incidental, like
text-books or cyclopædias. I truly congratulate
you, Patty, girl, on your real success in this
instance. But I also ask of you not to go into
anything of such a public nature again, without
consulting me first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Father Fairfield, I promise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then they were at home again, and the
luncheon hour was enlivened by Patty’s descriptions
to Nan of her wonderful new toy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you going to give it a name, Patty?”
Nan asked, after hearing of its glories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; but not until after I’ve used it. I can’t
tell, you see, just what sort of a name it needs
until I try it. And, Nan, let’s do a little shopping
this afternoon. I want a new motor-coat,
and a few other trifles, to live up to the appearance
of that thing of beauty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shopping was done, some marvellous
motor-apparel was purchased, and then, the next
day, the departure from New York was made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They reached “The Pebbles” in mid-afternoon,
and the ocean and sky were a glowing
mass of blue and white and gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan’s well-trained servants had the house open
and ready for them, and Patty flew up the
steps and into the great hall with a whoop of
delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it great, Nan! Isn’t it fine! More
fun than travelling abroad or touristing through
Sunny It.! For, you see, this is our own home
and we own it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty, your enthusiasm will wear you out
some day. Do take it more quietly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t do it! I’m of a nervous temperament
and exuberant disposition, and I have to express
my thinks!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big hall was in reality a living-room. It
extended straight through the house, with wide
doors at either end. It had alcoves with cushioned
seats, a huge fireplace, deep-seated windows,
and from one side a broad staircase
curved upward, with a landing and balcony halfway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wicker furniture was well-chosen and picturesque,
besides being very comfortable and
inviting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just as soon as I can get a few things flung
around, it will be perfect,” announced Patty.
“At present, it’s too everlastingly cleared-up-looking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She tossed on a table the magazines she had
bought on the train, and flung her long veil over
a chair back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, you see!” she said. “Watch that
veil flutter in the seabreeze,—our own seabreeze,
coming in at our own front door, and
then tell me if ‘The Pebbles’ is a success!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; and, unless you shut that door, you’ll
have a most successful cold in your head,” observed
her father. “It’s May, to be sure, but
it doesn’t seem to be very thoroughly May, as
yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Patty shut the door, and then, opening the
piano, she sang “Home, Sweet Home,” and
then some gayer songs to express her enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her own rooms, Patty concluded, were the gem
of the house. From her balcony, on which she
proposed to sleep, she had not only a wide view
of the sea, but an attractive panorama of the
beautiful estates along the shore. A hammock
was slung between two of the pillars, and,
throwing herself into this, with an Indian
blanket over her, Patty swayed gently back and
forth, and indulged in daydreams of the coming
summer. An hour later, Nan found her
still there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come to tea, Patty,” she said; “we’re having
it indoors, as the wind is rising.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it’s breezing up quite some;” and Patty
looked out at the waves, now so darkly blue as
to be almost black.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She followed Nan downstairs to the hall, and
looked approvingly at the tea-table, set out near
the blazing wood-fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lovely!” she cried. “I believe I am chilly,
after all. But the air is fine. Buttered muffins,
oh, goody! Father, the table bills will be a
lot bigger down here than in the city.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I daresay; but I won’t begrudge them, if
you will put some more flesh on that willowy
frame of yours. You’re not strong, Patty, and
I want you to devote this summer to building
yourself up physically. No study, not much
reading, no ‘Puzzle Contest’ work. Just rest,
and exercise moderately, and spend most of your
time out-of-doors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, daddy dear, your plans and specifications
exactly suit me! How strange that our
ideas should be the same on this subject! You
see, with my new Stanhope, I’ll be out-of-doors
all day, and, as I propose to sleep in the open,
I’ll be out-of-doors all night. Can I do more?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not sure about this sleeping outside. You
must never do it on damp or foggy nights.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, father, the sanitariums advise it for
everybody—every night. Well, I’ll agree not
to sleep out in a thunderstorm, for I’m scared
to death of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you mustn’t begin it yet, anyway. It’s
too cold. Wait until June, and then we’ll see
about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, I’ll agree to that. Why, somebody’s
coming up the front walk! Nan, here
comes our first caller. Wow! She’s a dasher!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few moments, Jane, the new parlour maid,
admitted the visitor, and she came in with a self-important
flutter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you do?” she said, cordially. “I’m
Miss Galbraith,—Mona Galbraith, your next-door
neighbour. At least, we live in the house
with red chimneys, two blocks down, but there’s
no house between us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you do, Miss Galbraith,” said Nan,
rising to greet the guest, and followed by the
others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” went on the young woman, volubly,
after she had accepted the seat offered by
Mr. Fairfield, “I thought I’d just run right
in, informally, for you might feel a bit lonesome
or homesick this first day. So many people
do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Patty, smiling, “we’re not lonesome
or homesick, but it was nice of you to
come to see us in this neighbourly fashion. Have
a muffin, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, I will; what delicious muffins! Did
you bring your servants with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some of them,” said Nan. “We’re simple
people, and haven’t a large retinue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we have,” said Miss Galbraith. “And
I’m at the head of the whole bunch. Just father
and I; we live alone, you know. Will
you come to see us? Come to dinner, soon,
won’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll see about it,” said Nan, who scarcely
knew how to take this self-possessed and somewhat
forward young person.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Galbraith wore a costume of embroidered
white linen, but the embroidery was too elaborate,
and the style of the gown rather extreme.
She wore a long gold chain, with what Patty
afterward called half a peck of “junk” dangling
from it. There were a lorgnette, a purse,
a cardcase, a pencil, a vinaigrette, a well-filled
key-ring, and several other trifles, all attached
to the chain, and Miss Galbraith played with
the trinkets incessantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope we’ll be real good friends,” she said,
earnestly, to Patty. “I want an intimate friend
awfully, and I like your looks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Patty couldn’t honestly return the compliment,
she said nothing in reply. Miss Galbraith’s
personal appearance was comely, and
yet it was not of the type with which Patty
was accustomed to be friendly. Her sandy hair
was too much curled and puffed, piled too high
on her head, and held with too many jewelled
<a id='pin'></a>pins; while her rather large hands showed too
many rings for a young girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her high-heeled, white shoes were too tight
for her, and her easy attitudes and frank
speech were too informal for a first call on
strangers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, we shall be friends,” said Nan,
with just enough absence of enthusiasm in her
tones to convey to a sensitive mind her reservations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Miss Galbraith hadn’t a sensitive mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear Mrs. Fairfield,” she said, effusively,
“how good you are! I see you have the neighbourly
instinct. Isn’t it nice that we’ll all be
down here together for the whole summer? Do
you swim, Miss Fairfield? and do you love to
dance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” began Patty, “but——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she hesitated, Mr. Fairfield came to his
daughter’s rescue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be frank, Miss Galbraith,” he said, “I
am trying to keep my daughter rather quiet this
summer. I want her to exercise only moderately,
and I must positively forbid much dancing,
and late hours, and all that sort of thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’s all right,” returned the visitor;
“nobody keeps very late hours at Spring Beach.
Well, I must run away now,—and I give you
fair warning! If you don’t come and return my
call soon, I’ll come straight over here and return
it myself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook a playful finger at Patty, and, after
voluble leave-takings, she went away, tripping
down the walk with the satisfied air of one who
has accomplished her object.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well!” said Patty, with an air of utter
exasperation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Well!</span>” exclaimed Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Fairfield smiled grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s our own fault,” he said. “We should
have enquired as to the character of the neighbours
before we bought the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How soon can you sell it, father?” asked
Patty. “One more visitation like that would
give me nervous prostration! Mona! Mona,
indeed! I never saw a Mona before, but I
might have known they were like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But can’t you really stay here?” asked Mr.
Fairfield, in alarm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense, daddy, of course we can! Do
you think I’d let myself be dispossessed by a
mere Mona? No, sir; Nan and I can manage
her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t quite see how,” said Nan, thoughtfully.
“She’s that impossible sort. Oblivious
to manner, impervious to hints. Patty, she’s
dreadful!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course she is, Sweet Nancy. She isn’t our
sort. But I’ll attend to her. I don’t know how,
just yet, but I’ll find out. She’s a problem to
be coped with, a difficulty to be overcome. But
did you ever see such a gown? There was just
enough embroidery on it for three self-respecting
frocks. And her hair! Looked like the
wax ladies’ coiffures in the hair-store windows!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t make rude personal remarks, Patty,
girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, father, as if one could be rude to an
object like that! Well, people dear, let’s put
her out of our minds and hearts for the rest of
to-day, anyway. I won’t have the birthday of
‘The Pebbles’ spoiled by a slight incident like
that. Forget it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so the impossible Miss Galbraith was
voluntarily ignored.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:0.9em;'>SWIFT CAMILLA</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last the car came. Patty was in a flutter
of joyous expectation, and, as Miller
came whirring up the drive in it, the
whole family assembled on the veranda to admire
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it a beauty, Nan! Oh, isn’t it?” Patty
exclaimed, as the sunlight flashed gold sparkles
on the shining paint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is, indeed, Patty. I never saw such a
pretty one. Are you sure you can run it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes! I know how already. You just
stick in a key and turn it, and grab the brake-handle,
and take hold of the steering bar, and
push and pull whenever you think you ought
to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not very technical language,” said Mr.
Fairfield, smiling, “but I think you understand
the operation. Jump in, Puss; I’m going with
you for your first spin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, though Mr. Fairfield was an interested
spectator, Patty manipulated the car all by herself,
and seemed to know intuitively a great
many of the minor details.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s only one trouble, dad,” she said, as
they went spinning along the smooth, hard road,
“I can’t take you and Nan with me both at
once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind, girlie; when we feel as sociable
as that, we’ll go in the big car. Now,
Patty, let me see you change the speed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then followed a careful lesson, in speed changing,
stopping suddenly, turning, going backward,
and all the various emergencies that occur
in driving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You certainly are a born motorist, Patty,”
said her father, at last. “You are unusually
clever and quick-witted about knowing what to
do, and doing it swiftly and cleanly. Hesitation
in motoring often means trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s because I love it, father. I’d rather motor
than go driving or boating or even flying.
Aren’t you glad I don’t want an aëroplane,
daddy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wouldn’t get it, if you did. Not even
if you earned it yourself, as you did this car.
Now, Patty, turn around and let’s go home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Skilfully, Patty turned around, and they sped
on their homeward way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some things you must promise me, Patty,”
said her father, seriously, as they drew near the
house. “Never start out without knowing
pretty definitely how long it will take you, and
when you’ll return. Never go without being
sure you have enough current for the trip. Of
course, Miller will look after this for you, but
I want you to understand it thoroughly yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I want to learn all about the working
parts, and how to repair them, if necessary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will come later. Learn to run it perfectly,
first. And, too, I want you to promise
never to start anywhere so late that there’s even
a possibility of your being out after dark. I
wouldn’t let you go out alone, or with a girl
friend, in the city, but down here you may do
so, if you never travel except by daylight. You
understand, Patty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, father, and I promise. As you know,
I only want to go on little, short drives, two
or three hours, usually.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well. I trust you not to do anything
of which I would disapprove. You’re a good
girl, Patty; at least, you mean to be. But sometimes
your enthusiasms and inclinations run
away with you, and you have no sense of moderation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m,” said Patty, smiling; “now I’ve been
lectured enough for one lesson, father dear.
Save the rest for another day, and watch me
whiz up this drive to the house like an expert.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did so, and Nan, awaiting them, exclaimed
with pride at Patty’s skilful driving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your turn now, Nan,” the girl called out;
then, mindful of her promise, she looked at her
watch. “It’s just three,” she said. “Let’s go
over to the Arbutus Inn Tea Room, have a cup
of tea, and get back home before six? How’s
that, father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right, my good little girl. I don’t
believe you’ll have any trouble running it, do
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed! It’s as easy as pie! I just love
to run it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon Nan was ready, and the two started off
in great glee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can hardly believe you really have the car,
Patty; didn’t you learn to run it very quickly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you see, I have driven cars before.
Big ones, I mean. And this is different, but so
much simpler, that it’s no trouble at all. Oh!
Nan, isn’t the scenery gorgeous?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gorgeous wasn’t at all the right word, but a
tamer one would not have suited Patty’s mood.
They were rolling along the coast: on one side
the ocean; on the other, an ever-changing panorama
of seashore settlements with their hotels
and cottages, interspersed with stretches of fine
woods, or broad, level vistas with distant
horizons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s beautiful, Patty. We’ll have a lovely
time this summer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; don’t let’s have too much company.
I’d like to have Christine down for a few weeks,
and of course Elise will make us a visit; but I
don’t want that horde of boys.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?” asked Nan, in amazement, for
Patty greatly enjoyed the boys’ calls in New
York.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know! It’s so quiet and peaceful,
just with us; and, if they come, they’ll stir
up picnics and dances and all sorts of things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know what’s the matter with you, Patty,”
said Nan, laughing; “you’ve got automobile
fever! You just want to ride and ride in this
pretty car of yours, along these good roads, and
just give yourself up to indolent enjoyment
of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just it! How did you know, Nan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, everybody feels that way when they first
own a car. I’ve often noticed it. Sometimes
they want to ride entirely alone, and just revel
in automobility.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gracious, Nan! What a word! Well, I
might want to go all alone once in a while; but
usually I want some one to rave about it all
with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m ready to rave at any time. Isn’t
that the Inn, off there to the right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, so it is. How quickly we’ve come!
Nan, there’s a line of poetry in my mind, and I
can’t think of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, what a catastrophe! Is it the only line
you know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be silly. But, truly, I do want to think
of it, for it’s about the name of this car.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps a cup of tea will quicken your wits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps. Well, we’ll try. Jump out, Nan;
here we are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By a clever little contrivance, Patty could lock
her car, and so feel sure it would not be tampered
with. In a country place, like this somewhat
primitive roadhouse where they now were,
this was a decided satisfaction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tea Room, though small, was dainty and
attractive. It was kept by two pleasant-faced
spinsters, and, though their clientèle was not
large, they sometimes served guests at several
tables.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only a little after four,” said Patty, looking
at her watch. “We can stay till five, Nan, and
then get home by six.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” returned Nan, who was walking
along the narrow garden paths, admiring the
old-fashioned flowers and tiny box borders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty went into the little Inn, ordered tea and
hot waffles and cakes, and then returned to
Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a dear little place,” she said. “I’ve
heard of it, but I’ve never been here before.
Tea will be ready in twenty minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When served, the little repast was delightful.
Old-time silver and old-fashioned china made
it all seem quaint and interesting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They dawdled over their tea, sometimes chatting,
sometimes sitting silent. It was a bit of
good fortune that these two were so congenial,
for, Fate having thrown them together, they
were much in each other’s company. As there
was but six years’ difference in their ages, their
relation was far more like sisters than like
mother and daughter. And, though Nan never
dictated to Patty, she taught her much by example,
and, at the same time, she herself learned
some things from her stepdaughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“S’pect we’d better move on, Nannie,”
said Patty, at last, as it was nearly five.
“I’ll pay the reckoning for this feast, and
then we’ll start. Oh, it has just come to
me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What has?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That line of poetry that I couldn’t think of!
This is it, ‘When swift Camilla scours the
plain.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what of it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, it’s the name for my car! Swift Camilla!
See?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A pretty name enough. But is she swift?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll speed her going home, and just show
you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty, don’t you dare! You know I’m only
going to motor with you if you go with great
moderation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right; I won’t scare you. But that’s her
name, all the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon the Swift Camilla was once more skimming
along the country roads. Patty went only
at moderate speed, for she had no wish to
frighten Nan, and, too, she had promised her
father to be very careful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were about halfway home, when Patty
saw a cow in the road ahead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish that old cow would get out of the
way,” she said. “A cow has no business to be
in the middle of the road like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She slowed down, and the car crawled along
behind the cow, but the indifferent animal paid
no heed to the motor or the horn, and ambled
along in mild indifference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, get out of the way!” cried Patty, exasperatedly.
Then, more coaxingly, “Please,
cow, nice cow, do get out of the way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This brought no response, and Patty grew
angry again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shoo! Cow! Shoo! Get out of the road!
If you don’t, I’ll—I’ll——” But she could
think of no direful deed that would affect the
cow, so she paused. Then she resorted to sarcasm:
“A nice sort of cow you are, anyway!
Alone and unattended on a country road! Why,
anybody might kidnap you! Where’s your cow-herd,
or whatever you call him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty, don’t be silly,” said Nan, choking
with laughter. “Get out and chase the cow
away. Hit her with a stick, or something.
Throw a little stone at her,—just a very little
one. Don’t hurt her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty’s eyes grew round with horror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Nan Fairfield, I’m more afraid of
that cow than of all the automobiles in the
world! I’m <span class='it'>terribly</span> afraid of cows! I’m more
afraid of cows than of <span class='it'>anything</span>, except a
mouse! But a mouse wouldn’t block up the
road so dreadfully. Nan, you get out and chase
the cow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,—no,” said Nan, shuddering. “I’m
afraid of cows, too. Patty, I’ll tell you what!
Steer <span class='it'>around</span> the cow!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just the thing! I believe there’s just about
room enough. If she’ll only stay in the middle,
now. Which side do you think there’s more
room, Nan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the right. Go round her on the right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was plenty of room, and Patty steered
carefully out toward the right, and passed the
cow safely enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurrah!” she cried, but she hurrahed a
trifle too soon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she directed her car back to the hard road,
she discovered that she had sidetracked into a
very sandy place. The front wheels of her
car were all right, but the hind wheels were
stuck in the sand,—one but a little, the other
deeply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put on more speed!” cried Nan. “Hurry,
before it sinks in deeper!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty put on more speed, which, contrary
to her intent, made the hind wheels sink
lower and lower in the soft sand. The car
had stopped, and no effort of Patty’s could
start it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at Nan with a comical smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Adventure No. 1!” she said. “Oh, Nan,
we can’t get home by six! Indeed, I don’t see
how we can ever get home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you frightened, Patty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; there’s nothing to be frightened about.
But I’m—well, hopping mad just about expresses
my feelings! You see, Nan, it’s like a
quicksand; the more we struggle to get out, the
deeper we get in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m; what are you going to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just plain nothing, my lady; for the simple
reason that there’s nothing to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And do you propose to sit here all night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s as Fate wills it! Do you suppose
father will come to look for us,—say, along toward
midnight?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty, don’t be a goose! Fred will be scared
to death!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I’m a goose? Oh, no! he knows I
am, already. But, Nan, I’ve an idea. If I were
only strong enough,—or if you were,—we could
lift out one of those fence rails, and stick it in
the sand in front of that deepest wheel, and get
her out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty, how clever you are! How do you
know that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I know it well enough. My general
gumption tells me it. But,—we’re neither of us
strong enough to boost it out of the fence and
under the wheel in the right way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we might do it together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We might try. Come on, Nan, let’s make
the effort. Bother that old cow, anyway! But
for her, we’d be almost home now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They got out of the car, and, with plucky effort,
tried to dislodge a fence rail. But it was
a fairly new and a well-made fence, and the
rails would not come out easily. They tried one
after another, but with no success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Nan, here’s my only solution to this
perplexing situation. We can’t sit here and let
father lose his mind worrying about it, and
thinking we’re ground under our own chariot
wheels. So one of us must stay here with the
car, and the other walk home and tell him
about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Walk home! Why, Patty, it must be five
miles!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I daresay it is, and I’d just as lieve walk it,
but I hate to leave you here alone. So you can
take your choice, and I’ll take the other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Patty, that’s absurd! Why not let one
of us walk to some nearby house and ask for
help?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Capital idea, but where’s the nearby house?
There’s none in sight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but there must be one nearer than
home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; and, when you go trailing off to look
for it, you’ll get lost. Better go straight home,
Nan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And leave you here alone? I won’t do it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then there seems to be a deadlock. Oh, hey!
Hi! Mister!! I say! Whoo-oo-ee!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan turned, frightened at Patty’s hullabaloo,
to see a man just disappearing round a fork in
the road. He had not seen them, and, unless
Patty’s quick eyes had spied him, and her sudden
call had reached his ears, he would have
been gone in a moment. As it was, he turned,
stared at them, and then came slowly over to
them. He was a rough, but not unkindly-looking
fellow, probably a farm labourer, and apparently
a foreigner. He spoke no English, but
Patty made him understand by gestures what
she wanted him to do. A look of admiration
came into his stolid eyes, at the idea of Patty
knowing enough to use the fence rail, and his
powerful strength soon removed a rail, and
placed it endwise under the wheel of the captive
car. Another was placed under the other
hind wheel, and, after much endeavour and
slipping and coaxing, the car was once again
freed from the sand, and stood proudly on the
hard road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty thanked the man prettily, and, though
he couldn’t understand a word, he understood
her grateful smiles. More clearly, perhaps, he
understood a banknote, which she drew from
her purse and gave him, and, with a grateful,
if uncouth bow of his awkward head, he trudged
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty started her car, and soon, at a good rate
of speed, they were flying along in the gathering
dusk.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span><h1>CHAPTER IX</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:0.9em;'>MONA AT HOME</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they reached home it was really
after dark, and Patty was prepared
for an expected reproof. But Mr.
Fairfield came out smilingly to meet them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Accident No. 1?” he asked. “What was
it? Power gave out, punctured tire, or misjudged
distance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None of those,” cried Patty, gaily; “but it
was a real accident, and a real unavoidable and
unforeseeable one!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, of course!” chaffed her father; “accidents
are always unavoidable, and never the
fault of the person driving!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad you’ve learned that,” said Patty,
saucily, “for, if you have that theory firmly
fixed in your mind, you have learned the main
principle of motor adventures!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then the three sat down on the veranda,
and Patty and Nan detailed the whole experience
to Mr. Fairfield.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were certainly in no way to blame,
Patty,” he said, heartily, “for, of course, you’ve
had no experience with sand, and had no reason
to suspect that the wheels would sink. But
you’ve learned the lesson, and now that particular
trouble is not likely to occur again,
for you will remember to stick to the hard
roads.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, you see, the particular trouble was really
the cow, and, of course, she’s likely to occur
again at any time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then the only remedy that I can suggest is
to have a cow-catcher built on the front of your
car.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; I’m not going to spoil the perfect lines
of my beautiful Camilla by any unsightly device.
You see, father, the lines of that car
are simply perfect. I know this, because it says
so in the booklet the company gave me. And
it speaks quite highly of the car’s various points,
and accessories, and really goes so far as to
state that it is superior to any other car in the
market! And the longer I use it, the more fully
I agree with the booklet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad your long experience justifies the
company’s claims. Have you named the car
Camilla?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, because she scours the plain; don’t you
remember how swift Camilla scoured the
plain?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I remember, but it seems a more appropriate
name for some patent cleaning powder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense, daddy! Have you no poetry or
romance in your soul? Swift Camilla is a lovely
name for my car, and I mean to scour the plain
for miles around. Come on, Nan, let’s go and
tidy up for dinner. It’s getting late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is so,” said her father, “and, though I
sha’n’t be too severe with you this time, I must
mildly repeat that I want you hereafter to get
home from your scouring expeditions before
dark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure!” cried Patty, gaily, blowing him a
kiss from the tips of her fingers as she ran
away.</p>

<hr class='tbk102'/>

<p class='pindent'>The days flew by, and, as the weather was almost
always fine, Patty went scouring with Camilla
every day. Sometimes she took Nan,
sometimes her father, and sometimes she went
all alone for short drives up and down the coast.
She had no trouble with the car’s mechanism,
for it was really of superior make, and its management
was simple. But one afternoon, when
she asked Nan to go for a little spin, Nan replied:
“I will later, Patty, but first I think we
ought to go and call on Miss Galbraith. It is
more than a week since she was here, and,
in common courtesy, we ought to return her
call.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I don’t like her, and I don’t want to
go to see her,” declared Patty, a little petulantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t act like an infant! Your not liking
her has nothing to do with the case. We’ve
had other calls down here, and we’ve returned
them properly; now this is a social duty that
must be attended to, so come along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Nan, you go without me! Make excuses
for me, can’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I can’t; and I won’t! So go and put on
a pretty frock and come right along. We
needn’t stay long, and we can go for a short
motor ride after.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Patty went away to dress, for she realised
that she must go, however unwillingly. She put
on a pretty calling costume of white serge, with
black velvet collar and cuffs, and a large black
hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look lovely,” said Nan, as Patty joined
her in the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I like this frock,” said Patty, “but I’m
sure Miss Galbraith won’t; you know, her taste
runs to more elaborate costumes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, you can’t expect to suit everybody!
Come along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan herself was in pale-grey cloth, with hat
to match, and the two strolled along the short
distance to “Red Chimneys,” which they had
learned was the name of the Galbraith home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They turned in at the entrance gate, and saw
a large and massive stone house, with many red
chimneys. It was a handsome building, but
over-ornate in its architecture and decoration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Looks exactly like Mona,” said Patty, as
they drew near. “It’s just a mass of heavy
embroidery!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A footman answered their ring, and, taking
their cards on his silver tray, ushered them into
a drawing-room, and departed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a rather long interval before Miss
Galbraith appeared, and Patty fidgeted. The
golden hours of her afternoon were slipping
away, and she was impatient to go out with
Camilla.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But presently Mona Galbraith came downstairs,
and greeted them effusively. As she had
been when they saw her before, she was overdressed
and over-jewelled. She wore a house
dress of blue satin, but so befrilled and bedecked
with jabots of lace that it was not only unbeautiful,
but no way did it resemble the accepted
fashion of the day. An expensive and complicated
necklace of turquoises surmounted the blue
satin, and large-headed pins of the same blue
stone adorned the piled-up masses of hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty’s secret impulse was one of regret that
a fairly pretty girl could make such a dowdy
of herself, and she resolved, if ever they became
sufficiently well acquainted, she would try to
tone down Miss Galbraith’s frantic wardrobe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so glad to see you,” their hostess said,
“and, if you hadn’t come to-day, I was going
straight over to your house to tell you what I
thought of you! Oh, you naughty people, to
keep me waiting so long! Why didn’t you come
sooner?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh there’s been much to do,” said Nan,
“fitting ourselves into our new home; and, too,
I think we’re fairly prompt returning your
call.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, we mustn’t make calls and return calls;
that’s too formal. We’re neighbours, you
know, and we must just run in and out without
ceremony. Don’t you think so, Miss Fairfield?
Or, mayn’t I call you Patty? Please let me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty was good-natured and kind-hearted, but
she began to think that Miss Galbraith’s unwelcomed
familiarity must be checked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it a little soon for first names, Miss Galbraith?”
she asked, with a merry smile that
took the rudeness from her question. “I like
to win my friendships by degrees, and not jump
into them suddenly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Miss Galbraith was not so easily baffled.
“Oh, are you like that?” she said. “Now
I’m just the opposite! I know at once if I like
anybody, and I do like you, and so I’m going to
call you Patty. Of course, if you’re so cautious
about making friends, you’ll have to adopt me
more slowly. But I’ll warrant it won’t be long
before you’ll call me Mona in spite of yourself.
And you, too, Mrs. Fairfield,” she added, turning
to Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty gasped, for she almost thought the forward
girl was going to call Nan by her first
name, but Mona did not go quite so far as
that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have a beautiful home here,” said Nan,
in order to change the subject. “Have you
lived here long?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the fourth summer,” said Mona;
“my father built it, and he said he didn’t care
what it cost, if only it was the most expensive
house at Spring Beach.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fancy he achieved his desire,” said Nan,
politely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, indeed! There’s no other house
been put up yet that cost nearly as much, and
I don’t believe there will be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Probably not,” said Patty. “But it seems
large for only two of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but we have a great many servants;
and, then, we like to have company. We invite
a great deal of company, though they don’t always
come. It’s strange how few people enjoy
the seashore.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty privately thought that there might be
other reasons for the guests’ refusals than a dislike
for the seashore, but she only said, “Yes,
I like to have company, too; but I’m never
lonely, even if I’m entirely alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I can see that’s your disposition,—sunshiny
and sweet always. Oh, I’m so glad you’ve
come to Spring Beach! I’ve wanted just such a
friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Patty said afterward, she felt herself being
drawn into a net, from which there seemed
to be no escape. But she determined to make
one more effort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to seem ungrateful,” she said,
“but, to tell the truth, I’m not very sociable.”
Then, like a flash, she realised that this was
not true, and endeavoured to amend it. “I
mean,” she went on, “in the summer time, when
I’m away from home. That is,—don’t you
know,—I think one likes a sort of vacation from
society during the summer; don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes! But, of course, the social doings
down here are not like those in the city. I’m
not much in society down here, myself; so we
can have real good times with each other, and
give society the go-by.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty gave up in despair. She couldn’t make
this girl understand that she did not desire her
intimate friendship, without being positively
rude; and, though of an independent nature,
Patty was always unwilling to hurt the feelings
of others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But very soon Nan rose to take leave, and the
call was over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What can I do?” exclaimed Patty, as they
were safely out of hearing distance of “Red
Chimneys.” “That girl is the limit! She’ll
be over to our house all the time, if I don’t do
something to stop her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, don’t take it too seriously!” advised
Nan. “Sometimes these troubles that loom up
so darkly fade away of themselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She won’t fade away,” declared Patty;
“Mona is no fader! But some day I shall
take her out in my motor car, way, way out
beyond civilisation, and come back without
her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a splendid plan!” said Nan, approvingly;
“practical, sensible, and easily carried
out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, isn’t it,” said Patty, grinning. And
then they were at “The Pebbles” again, and
were soon arrayed in their motor toggery, and
starting away in the Swift Camilla.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which way?” asked Patty, as she grasped
the steering bar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Straight along the coast,” answered Nan;
“the ocean is so beautiful to-day, I don’t want
to get out of sight of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, here we go;” and Patty headed
the car south along the line, continuous shore
drive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nan,” she observed, as they flew along, “do
you happen to know of any remarkable, important,
and very-much-to-be-celebrated day that
is going to occur soon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Day?” repeated Nan, looking blank,—so
exceedingly blank that it seemed an assumed
expression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, day! <span class='it'>A</span> day,—<span class='it'>one</span> day,—an <span class='it'>especial</span>
day! Do try to think. It may occur next
week!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me see,” said Nan, in a deeply thoughtful
tone, “this is May,—so you can’t mean
Washington’s Birthday or Lincoln’s Birthday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! nor Christmas Day, nor St. Patrick’s
Day in the Morning! But, all the same, it’s
one of the most important dates in the annals
of Time, and I’ll give you one more chance to
save your reputation by guessing what it is, before
I tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, of course I have no idea when it occurs,
but, if I’m merely guessing, I’ll guess that
you refer to Mona Galbraith’s birthday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Nan! you are too exasperating! Another
speech like that and I’ll put you out of
this car and let you walk home! Now the occasion
to which I refer, and which you know
well enough, only you think it’s roguish to pretend
you don’t, is the birthday of one Miss
Patricia Fairfield! a clever and charming young
girl, who will on that day achieve the dignity
of being nineteen years old!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, sure enough, it <span class='it'>will</span> be your birthday
soon, won’t it?” exclaimed Nan, in affected
surprise, which by no means deceived Patty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and what are you going to do about
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you ask me so suddenly, I scarce know
what to say! What do you want done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you ask me suddenly, too, but I know
exactly what to say! I want a celebration of
the event.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you do! brass band, and torch-light
parade?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not exactly that, but something just as good.
I want a house-party,—quite a large one,—to
come the day before the birthday, and stay several
days after, and celebrate all the time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re so modest in your demands, Patty!
Why don’t you have something really worth
while?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be sarcastic, Nan; you’re too pretty
to say such things! Now take a deep interest in
my plans, won’t you, and help me decide
things?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Patty, I will, indeed. But I
thought you didn’t want company down here,
especially the boys, because you wanted to enjoy
your scouring the plain, all alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I did feel that way for a time, but I’m
getting over it. Anyway, I want to try having
company, and, if I don’t like it, I’ll try solitude
again. Now you see, Nan, my birthday is next
week, Thursday. I’d like to ask the people to
come Wednesday, and then stay over the weekend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Patty, I’ll do all I can to make
it pleasant for you. But, you know, we have
only four guest rooms. How big did you mean
your house party to be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, of course the two Farringtons and
Christine and Kenneth would be about all we
could accommodate. Then I thought, if Mr.
Hepworth and Mr. Van Reypen cared to come,
they could stay at the hotel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It doesn’t seem very hospitable to invite
them that way,” said Nan, demurring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then they’ll have to stay home,” said Patty,
cheerfully, “for, as you say, we have only the
four rooms to give them. I thought our house
was large, but it doesn’t seem so when you begin
to invite guests.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we’ll see about it,” said Nan.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span><h1>CHAPTER X</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:0.9em;'>THE COURTESY OF THE ROAD</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening they discussed the project
with Mr. Fairfield.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heartily approve of the plan,” he
said. “It’s time we had some young life down
here to stir Patty up. She’s getting too sentimental
from gazing at the sea and sky. And
I think it will be quite all right to invite two
of the men to lodge at the hotel. They can
come over here for all their meals, and so they
will practically be part of the house party. But,
Patty, are you sure you want this house party
for several days? You may find it more of a
burden than you think, to entertain guests so
long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, they’re not formal guests; it’s just a
young people’s frolic. We’ll go motoring and
swimming and picnicking just as we like. But,
of course, on my birthday I shall have a party,—a
real party.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t know enough people down here
to make an evening party,” said Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, I know several,” said Patty; “and
if we have eight or ten in the house, and get
eight or ten more from among the Spring Beach
cottagers, that will be enough for a small
dance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And there’s Mona,” put in her father, mischievously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, <span class='it'>Mona</span>! I’m not going to ask <span class='it'>her</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Patty,” said Nan, “you’ll have to ask
her,—your very next neighbour!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I won’t have to, either! I’m not going
to spoil my whole birthday just because she happens
to live next-door to me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty,” said her father, “I think you must
be a little more generous in your attitude toward
that girl. You may not like her altogether,
but you must be kind and polite to her, because,
in a country place like this, we do owe a certain
duty to our neighbours such as is never recognised
in New York. And I want you to grow
up an unselfish, generous woman, who would
sacrifice her own feelings to those of her neighbour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you’re right, <a id='fat'></a>father, and I will
try to conquer my dislike for that girl. But
you know what she is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know what she is; she is uncongenial,
and her manner irritates you. But there must
be some good in her, Patty, and suppose you
set yourself to work to find it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, daddy, I’ll go you; but won’t you
please let me wait until after my birthday is
over?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, child; I quite agree with Nan that you
must invite Miss Mona to your party: that is,
if you invite other cottagers. If you have only
your own house party, of course you needn’t ask
her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, I won’t ever ask her over here
while the house party is on, except the night of
my birthday, when I have the dance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may not be necessary to invite her,” said
Nan, smiling; “she’ll very likely invite herself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we’ll hope she won’t,” said Patty, with
a little sigh. “Now I’ll write to the others
to-night, and I hope they can all come. I think
they all will, unless maybe Christine will think
she cannot leave her work. But I’ll urge her
to come for a few days, anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty went off to the library to write her notes,
and so interested did she become in her party,
and her plans for her birthday celebration, that
she quite forgot her unpleasant and unwelcome
neighbour. Nor did she think of her again
until the next afternoon, when, as she swung in
a hammock on the front veranda, she saw Mona
Galbraith come walking up the drive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here you are, Patty,” called out the hearty
and irrepressible voice of her neighbour; “I
hoped I’d find you at home. I felt sort of
lonely, and I said to myself I’ll just run over
to Patty’s, and perhaps, if I ask her very prettily,
she’ll give me a ride in that little gem of a
motor car that she runs so well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty arose from the hammock, politely hiding
her annoyance at Mona’s arrival, and said:
“How do you do, Miss Galbraith? Sit down,
won’t you? I’m not sure that I’m going to
have the car out this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’s all right; never mind. Don’t get
it out purposely for me. I’ll sit here and chat
this afternoon, and we can take the ride to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Patty saw at once that she must either take
her visitor motoring that afternoon, or merely
defer the occasion, in which case she would have
her on her hands for the rest of the afternoon,
anyway. Of the two evils she concluded to
choose the less. And she also concluded that, as
her father had requested, she would be pleasant
to this girl, and try to find some likable qualities
in her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it was with a shade more cordiality that
she said: “Oh, yes, we can just as well go this
afternoon as any other! It’s a good day, except
that there’s a pretty stiff breeze blowing.
Are you dressed to go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, this gown is all right, and you can
lend me a hood and cloak or something. Haven’t
you extra ones?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, of course,” said Patty, wondering if this
girl had no idea of social formalities. “But
perhaps she never had anybody to teach her
things,” thought Patty, who, now that she was
trying to be generous-minded toward Mona,
found it easier than she had thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty rang for Miller, and ordered the car;
then she asked Mona to come into the house,
that she might fit her out with proper wraps.
It was a warm, pleasant day, so a dust cloak of
Nan’s, and a silk hood belonging to that same
amiable lady, were borrowed for Miss Galbraith’s
use.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I have all these things at
home,” she said, as she tied the ribbons under
her chin; and Patty wanted to say, “Why don’t
you go and get them, then?” but she well knew
it was because of Mona’s unwarranted feeling
of intimacy in the Fairfield household that she
borrowed their wraps instead of going for her
own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This whole principle was foreign to Patty’s
nature. Systematic and methodical herself, she
always used her own belongings, and never
would have dreamed of borrowing those of another,
unless through sheer necessity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s one thing,” she thought to herself,
“if I give her this ride and get it over with,
she may keep away while those other people are
here. I must be careful not to let her know they
are coming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The car was at the door and they were soon
started. Patty determined to be kind and pleasant
to her guest, but to avoid personalities, and
to say nothing which could be construed as an
invitation to further acquaintance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One point she conceded, however, and concluded
to call Miss Galbraith by her first name.
This she did, only because Mona persisted in
calling her Patty, and it sounded so purposely
stilted and ungracious to persist in saying Miss
Galbraith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty asked her guest to choose the road they
should take, and was surprised to find that
Mona knew of a great many lovely drives
which Patty had not yet discovered. Though,
of course, it was not surprising, as Mona had
spent four summers at Spring Beach, and it was
Patty’s first one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mona chose a route called the Blue Lake
Drive, which took them through a lovely stretch
of pine woods, and out into an orchard-dotted
country, the goal being a small and very blue
lake. On the shore was a tiny Tea House,
which proved a pleasant resting-place for a half-hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls sat sipping tea and eating crumpets,
and Patty began to think that Mona was not
nearly as unlikable as she had thought. Her
shortcomings were more those of an impulsive
and untrained nature than any more serious
faults. She was well educated and well read,
and Patty found that they had many favourite
books and authors in common. But she was
pushing, and she continually asserted her intention
of being Patty’s intimate friend, until
Patty lost her patience and broke out, rather
sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, Mona,” she said, “I like you,
or at least I think I’m going to like you, but
I won’t be pushed or pulled into a friendship
so suddenly. You don’t know me at all, but
once in a while I have a way of speaking my
mind right straight out, and I tell you frankly
that, if you want to be friends with me, you’ll
upset the whole kettle of fish by rushing it too
hard!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mona looked utterly amazed. “What are you
talking about?” she said. “Do you call me
pushing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do that!” declared Patty; “just exactly
that! and you know it as well as I do! I
shouldn’t talk to anybody like this on such short
acquaintance, but you brought it on yourself,
and, if you want to get angry, you may!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Angry!” echoed Mona. “Why, I like you
all the better for such straightforward talk!
I’m sorry I seem pushing, but,—well,—‘you
brought it on yourself’!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty had to laugh at this, for it was really
a subtle compliment to her own attractiveness.
Also, she decided she could do little by scolding
Mona. So she began to talk of other
things, leaving the question of friendship to
be settled some other time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon they started homeward again, for, as
Patty explained to her guest, she was under
promise to get home before dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How beautifully your car runs,” said Mona,
as they skimmed smoothly along. “Do you
never have an accident?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing of any account,” returned Patty,
and then she told Mona of the day when her
wheels got stuck in the sand. “But I have
never had anything more serious than that,”
she went on, “and I hope I never shall. Have
you never run a car yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it never occurred to me to do so. We
have several cars, of course, and lots of
chauffeurs and grooms, but only since I’ve seen
you in your car have I thought of driving one
myself. But I’m going to; I’ve already asked
father to get me one exactly like this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will he do it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course; he gets me anything I want. And
when I get it, Patty, we can go out together in
our two cars. Won’t that be fun?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m, h’m!” murmured Patty, who wasn’t
overjoyed at the proposition. “Gracious!
what’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my! what <span class='it'>is</span> the matter? Did something
burst?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It did so,” said Patty, cheerfully; “the inner
tube of this front wheel has burst, and now, if
you want to see a successful imitation of a young
lady mending her own motor car, just watch me
while I get out my little kit of tools, and put
my reserve tube in place of this burst one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you do it yourself?” enquired Mona,
with a look of surprised admiration. “I didn’t
know a girl could do things like that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This girl can,” returned Patty, opening her
tool-box with a capable air. But the next moment
her capable air completely vanished, and
she turned to Mona with a comical expression of
dismay. “What do you think?” she said.
“I’m always so careful to have my car and my
tools and my accessories all in perfect order,
and now see what’s happened! I had this same
experience the other day. The inner tube burst,
and I put in my reserve tube and then I put
the burst tube away in my kit, and here it is
yet. I utterly forgot to have it replaced by a
new one!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, then the reserve tube that you want to
put in is as burst as that one you have just taken
out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve struck it right! that’s the situation.
Now what’s the solution? There isn’t any answer!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, what do we do?” asked Mona, looking
scared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, we just sit here,” said Patty, returning
to her seat in the runabout. “It isn’t a question
of doing anything, because we can’t do anything.
We can sit here, or we can walk home.
Or, rather, you can walk home, if you want to.
I sha’n’t leave my car, if I sit here all night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I sha’n’t leave you, if we sit here all
night! But if I can walk anywhere, and get
assistance for you, I’ll gladly do so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mona, you’re a good deal of a trump,” said
Patty, looking into the girl’s earnest face; “but
I don’t know of any place you could get assistance
nearer than home, and that’s ten miles
away. You see, Mona, when motor cars do
break down, they invariably choose a place far
away from any garage or repair shop. The
farther away it is, the better the car likes it.
Can’t you hear Camilla chuckling at our discomfiture?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can you joke, Patty? I think it’s
awful! What can we do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can’t do anything, but, if we’re patient,
some one may come along who can help us. You
know, there’s a certain courtesy of the road
among motorists that makes them help each
other whenever they can. At least, this courtesy
is said to exist, but I’ve never seen much
of it, myself. However, I’ve had very few occasions
to desire it. Now we’ll sit and wait for
courtesy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor did they wait long. Very soon a good-sized
motor came by, and the polite driver of
it stopped and asked the girls if he could be
of any assistance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty liked his quiet, courteous manner, and
she explained her difficulty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the man, though willing, was unable to
help her, for his tires were not the same size
as those on Patty’s ear. He would have been
glad, he said, to tow her car, but he was going
in the other direction. So Patty thanked him
for his interest in the matter, and he went on
his way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, you see,” observed Patty, “that there
<span class='it'>is</span> a courtesy of the road. I’ve no doubt some
more courtesy will come along soon, and we’ll
get fixed up somehow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But courtesy seemed to be scant that afternoon,
for half a dozen cars, both large and small,
whizzed past them apparently without noticing
their plight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, however, a man came by alone in
a small electric runabout, not unlike Patty’s
own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hi! there!” he called out, “you in trouble?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty did not like his mode of address, nor did
she like the looks of the man himself. And
even though she greatly desired his help, and
felt sure that he might have a reserve inner tube
which would fit her tire, she hesitated to ask
him for it, as she so distrusted and disliked his
general appearance. He looked good-natured,
but he did not look to be a man of refinement.
But while she hesitated, Mona, greatly to
Patty’s surprise, took the situation in hand, and
called back to the man: “Yes, we’re in a dreadful
fix! Can’t you help us out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You bet I can!” cried the man, and, springing
from his own car, he came over to Patty’s
side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s wrong, little one?” he said, looking
boldly into Patty’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty was thoroughly annoyed at his manner,
but now that things had gone so far, of course
she must carry it through. Sitting up very
straight, and assuming an air of severe dignity,
she said: “The inner tube of a front wheel has
burst, and I have no good one with which to
replace it. If you have one you could spare, I
should be glad to have it, and I will send you
a duplicate one, if you will give me your address,
or my father will send you a cheque for
the price of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man looked at Patty and smiled. “You
needn’t be so crusty about it,” he said; “the
other young miss ain’t so crusty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty was becoming a little frightened. The
man was so easy-mannered, and, though she felt
sure she could manage all right by herself, she
had a fear that Mona might say something foolish
at any moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t mean to be crusty,” said Patty, smiling
pleasantly, but without friendliness. “I’m
simply asking the courtesy of the road from a
fellow-motorist, and I feel sure, if you can, you
will give it to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man backed away a little and looked at
Patty with unmistakable admiration. “Well, I
just guess I will!” he replied, and went straight
to his own tool-box for implements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty took this opportunity to whisper to
Mona, “Don’t you say another word to him!
You mustn’t speak to strangers so familiarly.
You came near making serious trouble for
us!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Mona was of such a peculiar disposition
that, instead of realising the truth of
Patty’s words, she became incensed at the idea
of being scolded, and made no reply, save to
pout her lips and assume a very angry expression
of countenance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man returned from his own car, and in
a short time had inserted a new inner tube, and
Camilla was in perfect order for a fresh start.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thank you very much,” said Patty, with
a calm, gracious politeness; “and, if you’ll give
me your card, or your address, my father will
send you a cheque for the tire, and a note of
thanks for your kindness to his daughter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“’Taint worth mentioning,” said the man,
looking a little sheepish before Patty’s courteous
dignity; “and I haven’t a card, but here’s my
name, and I’ll be glad to hear from your father,
miss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He scribbled on a bit of paper and gave the
address to Patty, who put it in her cardcase,
and, bowing civilly to the man, she started her
car and drove swiftly away.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span><h1>CHAPTER XI</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:0.9em;'>THE FIRST ARRIVALS</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mona,” said Patty, severely, as they
drove along, “you ought to know better
than to talk to a strange man in
that familiar way! He wasn’t a nice man at
all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he helped us out of our difficulty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and he’ll be paid for it. But there was
no occasion to talk to him as you would to an
acquaintance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m not so awful stuck-up as all
that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t a question of stuck-upness! Or, if
you do call it that, it was just the time to be
stuck-up. Proper civility is all very well, but
you needn’t be chummy with a stranger. And
I give you fair warning, Mona, that, if you
want to be friends with me, you must never do
that sort of thing again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do want to be friends with you, Patty, and
I think I see what you mean now, but I didn’t
think I was doing any harm. I’m glad to have
you scold me, Patty, for I do want to do what’s
right. You see, I never had much bringing-up.
My mother died when I was a little girl, and
since then father has indulged me in everything
I wanted, but I’ve really had none of what you
may call social training.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty was amazed at the sudden humility of
the girl whom she had considered arrogant and
self-satisfied. She began to think that she might
do a good work in teaching Mona some things
of which she seemed to have no idea, but which
came to Patty by instinct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My mother died when I was very little, too,”
she said; “but I think my father brought me
up as well as any woman could have done. And,
then, I have the dearest stepmother. She’s just
the perfection of all that’s sweet and gentle and
refined.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a lucky girl, Patty, and I envy you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, that’s silly! You’re a lucky girl to
have such an indulgent father, and oceans of
money, and freedom to do exactly as you
choose. Why, you have all sorts of possibilities,
Mona. You could make yourself anything
you want to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you help me, Patty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes, as far as I can.” Though Patty
felt kindly disposed toward the girl, and wanted
to help her, she didn’t care to take the entire
responsibility of shaping her future, and she
knew Mona’s pushing spirit would demand this,
if given a chance. So she dropped the subject
for the present, and they chatted gaily of all
sorts of things. And, when at last Patty set
Mona down at her own door, she had not mentioned
the subject of her birthday, or said that
she was expecting a house party of young people
to visit her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On reaching her own home, Patty related to
her father and Nan the experience she had had.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You did exactly right, Patty, girl,” said her
father, “and I will send the man a cheque for
the tube, and a letter of thanks for his kindness
to my daughter, just as you told him I
would do. I’m surprised that Mona should
have acted as she did, for I supposed any young
girl of the present day would know better than
to speak familiarly to a stranger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wasn’t so much what she said, father, as
her gay and easy manner, and the way she smiled
at him. She showed no reserve or dignity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I understand, and I am glad you reproved
her. You may do her some good, Patty,
by your influence and example.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty sighed a little. “I’m willing to help
her, but I don’t want to take the whole burden
of her social education on my shoulders.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty,” laughed Nan, “don’t take it so seriously.
You’re not employed as nursery governess
at ‘Red Chimneys’ yet, and the few occasions
when you have opportunity to drop a
good seed on Mona Galbraith’s thorny soil, it
won’t hurt you a bit to do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurray for Nan!” cried Patty; “she always
hits the nail on the head and rings the
bull’s-eye! Well, anyway, I didn’t tell Mona
about my birthday, or that I expect company.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wasn’t really necessary,” said Nan, drily;
“she’ll probably be over here a good deal of
the time, anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not if I see her first!” retorted Patty,
though she knew in her heart, if Mona chose to
come, she couldn’t help herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said her father, “now that we’ve all
denounced Mona sufficiently, I’ll express my
opinion of Miss Patricia Fairfield. Any little
girl who pretends to keep her motor accessories
in order, and then blithely rides away with an
old burst tube in her repair kit, is, to my mind,
as I’ve had occasion to tell her before, a feather-headed
butterfly!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, don’t call me such dreadful names!”
pleaded Patty, wringing her hands in mock
despair. “Do let me down more easily than
that! I’ve never done such a thing before, and
I’m perfectly certain I never shall again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe you ever will,” returned her
father, kindly, and he said no more about what
was really somewhat culpable carelessness.</p>

<hr class='tbk103'/>

<p class='pindent'>The next day the guests arrived. It was
Wednesday, and the birthday was on Thursday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elise and Roger were due at three o’clock.
Mr. Hepworth was to bring Christine down a
little later, and they were expected at five; while
Kenneth and Mr. Van Reypen could not reach
Spring Beach until seven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, a little before three, Patty started in her
car to go to the station to meet the Farringtons.
As Elise and Roger stepped off the train, they
saw her sitting smiling at them, and they made
a rush for the Stanhope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a ducky little motor!” cried Elise.
“Oh, Patty, it’s the prettiest one I ever saw!
and it’s so becoming to you! Shall I get in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” answered Patty, as she gaily greeted
them both. “I’ll take you over to the house,
Elise, but I can’t take you both. Roger, if you
don’t mind, will you go in that stage vehicle,
and I’ll give you a ride in my car some other
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, of course, Patty; and I’ll look after the
luggage. You two girls go on, and I’ll see you
later. Where do I go to, Patty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, just tell the driver to take you to Mr.
Fairfield’s house. He knows where it is. We
call it ‘The Pebbles,’ but he may not know it
by that name. But you’ll get there, somehow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’ll get there!” declared Roger, and,
with laughing good-byes, the two girls drove
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you love your car, Patty?” asked
Elise, as they went swiftly along.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I do, Elise. I love it almost as I would
a human being. I’ve never told any one this,
because it seems sort of silly. But sometimes,
when I’m out alone in it, I talk to it just as I
would to a person, and she seems to understand.
I’ve named her the Swift Camilla, and somehow
Camilla seems to understand everything I
say to her, and she almost talks back. Then,
when I take other people with me, Camilla likes
or dislikes them. If she dislikes them, she shows
it by not running quite so smoothly. She jumps
and balks and shies, for no reason at all, except
petulance. Isn’t that so, Camilla?” and Patty
patted the side of the car with a caressing
gesture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does she like me?” asked Elise, anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed! Don’t you see she’s flying along
like a bird! She knows you understand her,
Elise, and you don’t think she’s merely an inanimate
object.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Inanimate object! No, indeed! With her
pulses thrilling and her sensitive nature alive
to every passing incident, she’s far from inanimate!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty looked at Elise in surprise. “Why,
girlie,” she said, “I didn’t know you had so
much imagination in your make-up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve always felt that way about motor cars,
Patty. Our great big car is lumberly and fat,
and a little bit stolid of disposition; but father
has a little runabout that’s the nervousest thing
you ever saw. But this Stanhope! Well, I’ve
simply got to have one like it, that’s all! Father’ll
give it to me in a minute, if I only could
persuade mother to let me run it alone. But
I’m ’most sure she never will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This car of mine seems to sell others for the
company,” said Patty, laughing. “There’s a
girl down here, next door to me, who says she’s
going to get one, too. And I know the boys will
all fall in love with this little beauty!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meaning the car or the girl next door?”
asked Elise, smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, the car! The girl next door isn’t a little
beauty! Well, that is, I suppose she is
good-looking in her own way, but——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you don’t like her, isn’t that it?” and
Elise smiled at her own intuition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t like her,” declared Patty, honestly;
“but I’m trying to. I’ll tell you all
about it some other time, and, anyway, you’ll
probably see her for yourself while you’re here.
This is her home we’re passing now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gorgeous place,” said Elise, as she looked
at the imposing “Red Chimneys.” “But I
like this next place better. This big white house
is lovely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good for you, Elise! This is ‘The Pebbles,’
and your own destination.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty turned into the drive, and stopped at
the broad steps of the front veranda. Nan was
there to welcome them, and the two girls sprang
out as Miller appeared to take the car away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roger will be here soon!” exclaimed Patty,
while Nan greeted Elise warmly. “He’s coming
over in the stage, and he’ll bring the luggage.
Come on, Elise, I’ll show you your
room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two girls went off, and Patty took Elise
to one of the pretty guest rooms. They stayed
there chatting until Elise’s trunk came, and
then Patty declared she must run down and
entertain Roger, while Elise unpacked her
things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She found the boy still on the front veranda
talking to Nan, with whom he was a great favourite.
Indeed, all Patty’s boy friends were
favourites with Nan, and she was so charming
and attractive herself that they all liked to chat
with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kenneth Harper she looked upon as her especial
protégé, for he was alone in the city; and
Mr. Hepworth, of course, was one of her old
friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Philip Van Reypen, Nan had liked him
from the first, and they had established a very
chummy acquaintance. So, on the whole, the
house party bade fair to be a great success, and
Nan expected to enjoy its fun almost as much
as Patty herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re getting brown, Patty,” said Roger,
looking admiringly at the tanned face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it’s outdoorsiness as does it! I swim
and walk, and play tennis and go motoring all
day long, and I sleep on a veranda at night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you get tanned by the moon as well as by
the sun,” said Roger. “Well, it’s very becoming,
and you look a whole lot healthier than
you did in the city.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I am. Come on out and see my car,
Roger, and I’ll give you a little spin, if you
like. Elise is unpacking her finery and won’t
miss us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like every one else, Roger was enthusiastic
in his praise of the wonderful car, and gladly
accepted Patty’s invitation to go for a short
ride. He complimented Patty on her skilful
driving, and they went for some distance along
the coast road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me drive back,” said Roger, as they
turned homeward, and so they changed seats
for the return trip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beautiful car!” he repeated; “and perfect
mechanism. Patty, I congratulate you on winning
the thing, and it’s wonderful to think you
did win it all yourself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I had a lot of help, you know!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it was your own enterprise, and you
worked pretty hard yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I did;” and Patty smiled at the recollection.
“I sat up nights with those hundred
questions, and lots of times I thought I should
fail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But still you persevered. That’s where
you’re such a brick, Patty. If you set your
heart on anything, you never give up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m glad I persevered this time, anyway,
for this car is a perfect joy to me. I suppose
father would have given me one, if I had
asked for it, but somehow it never occurred
to me that I wanted one. I had no idea I’d
love it as I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, they’re great things, and I’m jolly glad
you’ve got this one. You’ll enjoy it more every
day you own it. Now here we are at ‘The
Pebbles.’ Do you want to turn in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; and I’m going to turn you out. Then
I’m going to take the car and go back to the
station to meet Christine. She’s coming down
with Mr. Hepworth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me go over with you, then I can give
Christine my place, and I’ll tote old Hepworth
over here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right; but I must see Elise before I go,
and tell her where I’m going.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Patty’s surprise, Elise seemed a little annoyed
to learn that she was going to the train
for Christine. Patty had almost forgotten the
foolish jealousy that Elise had of her own
friendship with Christine. But, as always, she
thought the best way to treat it was to ignore
it; she simply repeated her statement. “Yes,
Elise,” she said, “I’m going over to the station
to bring Christine home with me. Mr. Hepworth
will come over in the stage. He’s going
to stay at the hotel, anyway; we haven’t room
for him here. But, of course, he’ll be over here
most of the time. Roger is going over with me,
and then he’ll get out, and give Christine his
place, and he’ll come back with Mr. Hepworth.
What will you do while I’m gone? Will you
dress for dinner, or will you take a little rest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were in Elise’s room, and her pretty
gowns and other finery were lying about, as she
had unpacked them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it doesn’t matter about me,” she said,
ungraciously; “you go on and meet your friend
Christine, and I’ll look after myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Elise, stop being a goose!” cried Patty,
grasping her by the shoulders and kissing her
on both cheeks. “If you talk like that, you’ll
spoil my whole house party and my birthday
and everything! Now, you’re my friend, and
Christine is my friend, and you two girls have
simply got to be friends with each other; so
make your mind up to that! If you say another
snippy word on the subject, I’ll go and
lock myself in my own room, and stay there until
you go home!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elise laughed, for she was always a little
ashamed of herself after an exhibition of her
petty jealousy, and Patty knew that she wouldn’t
repeat the offence, for the present at least.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ring for Louise,” Patty went on, “to
help you put away these pretty frocks and
things, and then you make yourself at home, and
do just what you want to until I come back with
Christine. And then, milady, you will be just
as sweet and charming to Christine as you can
possibly be! Catch on?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Elise, smiling, and Patty kissed
her again and ran away.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span><h1>CHAPTER XII</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:0.9em;'>A MOONLIGHT RIDE</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty seemed a little quiet as she and
Roger drove to the station, for she was
thinking how foolish Elise was, and what
a lot of trouble she could stir up, if she chose
to indulge in that stupid jealousy of Christine.
If Christine had been more able to resent it,
and take her own part, it would not have been
so bad, but she was so sensitive to the slightest
coldness, and so afraid of seeming to impose on
Patty’s friendship, that it made the situation a
little difficult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Roger’s gay banter revived Patty’s drooping
spirits, and, when they reached the station,
they were in a gale of laughter over some joking
nonsense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The train soon arrived, and they saw Christine
and Mr. Hepworth step down on to the
station platform.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roger met them, and conducted them to
Patty. Then there were more compliments and
congratulations on the new car, and soon Christine
was tucked in beside Patty, and the two
men waved them farewell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How are you, Christine?” asked Patty, looking
anxiously at the girl’s pale cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m all right. A little tired, but a day
or two down here will set me up wonderfully, I
know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A day or two! You must stay a week, at
least.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I can’t possibly, Patty. My work is
very important just now, and I must go back day
after to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll see about that;” and Patty wagged her
head, positively. “And look here, Christine,
while I have you by yourself, I want to tell you
something. Elise Farrington is here, you know,
and she has a silly notion of some sort that
makes her resent my friendship for you. Now
I want to ask you, as a special favour to me,
not to pay any attention to her foolishness. If
she snubs you right out, I’ll attend to her case
myself; but, if she just flings little bits of hateful
allusions at you, don’t mind them, will you,
dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t help it, Patty. Unkind speeches
shrivel me all up somehow; I just can’t stand
them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, stand them for my sake, please. You
know <span class='it'>I</span> can’t help it, and, if I had thought you
wouldn’t have a good time, I wouldn’t have
asked you here when Elise is here. But, you
see, it’s my birthday house party, and I want
all of my dearest friends with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you count me among them? Oh, Patty,
how good you are to me! Truly, I will try not
to be foolishly sensitive, and I promise not to
notice anything Elise may do or say, if I can
possibly help it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a good girl,” said Patty, giving
Christine’s arm a little squeeze. “But isn’t it
funny, Christine, that I have these little petty
troubles among my girl friends, and never
among my boy friends. The boys are all so
nice to me, and they never get jealous of each
other or anything silly like that. But you see
this place we’re just passing? It’s called ‘Red
Chimneys,’ and I have a girl friend in there,—at
least, she’s an acquaintance,—who makes me
a lot of trouble, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t make you trouble, Patty, do I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, of course, it’s mostly Elise’s fault, but,
if you’ll just ignore it, and stand up for your
own rights, you can help me a whole lot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will, Patty; indeed, I will!” said Christine,
earnestly, and then they arrived at “The
Pebbles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dinner that night was a gay and jolly feast.
It was the eve of the birthday, and the
house party had already assumed an air of
festivity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Van Reypen and Kenneth Harper had
come down later than the others, and Philip Van
Reypen had established himself at the hotel
where Mr. Hepworth was, while Kenneth was
a house guest at “The Pebbles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the men from the hotel came over to dinner,
and announced their intention of staying
as late as they would be allowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Also, to Patty’s dismay, Mona Galbraith had
come over just before dinner, and, as she was
still there when dinner was announced, Nan felt
herself really obliged to ask the girl to dine
with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty didn’t like it at all, but there was no
help for it, and so Mona stayed. She looked
very pretty that night, and was not quite so
overdressed as usual. Moreover, she made
herself bright and entertaining, without showing
any of her less desirable traits of character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seated between Roger and Mr. Van Reypen,
she ingratiated herself with both, and, when
Patty saw that the boys seemed to like Mona,
she felt rather glad she was there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After dinner they all drifted out to the verandas,
and, as it was a moonlight night and high
breakers were dashing in on the beach, there
was the usual chorus of admiration for the
glories of the seashore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was much gay chatter and laughter,
there was some desultory singing of songs, and
at last Elise jumped up, saying: “I just
can’t stand it any longer! I simply <span class='it'>must</span>
go down to the beach! Will anybody go with
me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will,” said Kenneth, gallantly. “I was
just thinking about that myself. Anybody else
want to go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to go,” said Christine, a little timidly,
and Patty looked up in surprise, at the
idea of Christine wanting to go with Elise anywhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Christine was longing to get down to the
water, and see the ocean nearer by, for it was
about two blocks from “The Pebbles,” though
no buildings intervened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mayn’t I go with you, Christine?” said Mr.
Hepworth; and, with a glance of gratitude,
Christine said, “Yes, indeed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, then,” sung out Kenneth. “All
ashore that’s going! Let’s all go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Roger said that the ocean must wait for
him until next day, for he was going over to
“Red Chimneys” with Miss Galbraith, just
then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What for?” asked Patty, in amazement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He wants to see father’s birds,” explained
Mona. “You know, my father has a really
wonderful collection of stuffed birds,—and he’ll
be delighted to show them to Mr. Farrington,
who says he is interested in them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Patty; “run along, you two.
But don’t stay late, Roger; we keep early hours
down here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Patty, I won’t;” and Roger walked
away with Miss Galbraith, while Patty looked
after them with a puzzled glance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The four who wanted to walk to the beach
had already started, leaving the two senior
Fairfields and Patty and Mr. Van Reypen on
the veranda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s perfectly heavenly to get away from the
city, and down to this beautiful, quiet, peaceful
spot,” said Philip Van Reypen, as he seated
himself on the veranda railing, and leaned
against a pillar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is your life in the city so full of strife that
you welcome peace?” asked Patty, smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, the city itself is full of strife,” returned
Van Reypen; “isn’t it, Mr. Fairfield?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; compared to the seashore, it certainly
is. This expanse of blue ocean is much more
peaceful and calm than a scene in Wall Street,
for instance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that’s what I mean; and to get down
here and just bask in the calmness and peace
is a great delight to me. It was awfully good
of you people to ask me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We like to have you here,” said Nan, smiling
at the young man’s frank and heartfelt gratitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I think it’s good of you to come,” said
Patty; “for you must have lots of invitations
to grander houses than this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My child,” said Philip Van Reypen, looking
at her, gravely, “it is not the grandeur of a
house that attracts me; it’s the grandeur of the
people. And I think you people are just grand!
But, tell me, how do you like the motor car
which you won by such strenuous exertion?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which you helped me to win,” said Patty.
“I never could have won it without your help.
And to think you haven’t seen it! Come out
to the garage now, and take a look at it. I’ve
never seen it by moonlight myself; and I know
it must look lovely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catching up a light wrap, Patty flung it around
her, and, with Mr. Van Reypen, walked around
the house to the garage. The full moon was
so very bright that, when the young man opened
the big doors, Patty’s car showed as clearly and
plainly as if it had been daylight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t she a beauty!” said Patty, in a voice
almost awestruck, for the moonlight touched
up the car with a sort of magic lustre never
seen by day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She sure is!” declared young Van Reypen,
with emphasis. “Wow! what perfection of
detail, and what beautiful finish! Can you run
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can I run it? Well, rather! Why, I’ve
run it hundreds of miles since I’ve had it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s get her out now, and just circle the
drive once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s too late now! I’ll take you out in
it to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense! it’s only about ten o’clock, and
it’s as light as noonday. Come on, let’s do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, I don’t mind. But just around the
drive; we won’t go out of the gate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, then; hop in. Let me drive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I want to show off my driving.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, wait until to-morrow for that, Miss Vanity.
I know you drive beautifully, but I want
to see how this thing works, myself. You know
I guessed some few of those puzzles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know you did. All right, then, you
drive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philip assisted Patty in, and then took his own
place and grasped the steering-bar and the controller.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My, but she is a daisy! All the modern
kinks in the way of mechanism!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They circled the driveway twice, and, when
passing the veranda, Patty turned to wave her
hand to her father and Nan, she discovered
they were not there. “Why, they must have
gone in!” she said, in surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps they went down to the beach,” suggested
Van Reypen. “Let’s go and see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were near the gateway then, and, before
Patty knew it, Philip had swung the car through,
and they were spinning along the shore road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The top of the car was down, and they had
an unobstructed view of sea and shore. The
night was still, save for the pounding of the
surf, and the crested billows frothed and dashed
on the white sand. The moon touched everything
with its magic, and the sea, the beach,
and the inland were alike shining with a silver
glory. The smooth, hard road stretched ahead
of them like a white ribbon, and it was small
wonder that Philip Van Reypen did not stifle
the impulse to send the car spinning ahead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” breathed Patty, entranced by the
wonderful beauty of the night, and the exhilaration
of that swift, soundless, gliding motion
through it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it great!” whispered Philip. “Did
you <span class='it'>ever</span> know anything like it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I <span class='it'>never</span> did! It’s like being in some
enchanted place! I’ve never before been out
at night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And there never was such a night as this!
Are you afraid?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, not a bit! I know my car too well,
and I know you are not driving recklessly,
though we are going pretty fast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philip slowed down his speed a little, and they
went steadily on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We oughtn’t to be doing this,” said Patty,
laughing like a gleeful child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?” asked her companion, in an aggrieved
tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, lots of reasons! For one thing, I’m a
hostess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but you haven’t any guests. They’ve
all scooted off by themselves in different directions;
even your father and mother deserted the
veranda, so I’m the only guest you have for
the moment, and, I assure you, I’m being very
pleasantly entertained.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So am I,” said Patty, demurely. “But
somehow I have an uneasy feeling that I’ll catch
a scolding for this! I’m not accustomed to going
out with a young man late at night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, I’m not very young, and it isn’t
very late, so don’t bother about that. And anyway,
if you’re going to catch a scolding, you
may as well have the fun first. And it <span class='it'>is</span> fun,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s gorgeous fun! I never enjoyed
anything more! But we mustn’t go any
further. We’re about three miles beyond Spring
Beach now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sure enough, they had gone beyond all signs
of habitation, and were on a long, straight
stretch of road, with the ocean on one side and
pine woods on the other. It was weirdly beautiful,—the
dark shadows of the pines, darker
than ever by contrast with the moonlighted
spaces. There was no boardwalk here, and the
sea dashed almost up to the road they were on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Philip, in answer to Patty’s
suggestion, “we will turn around in a minute.
We’ll just go to that next clump of pines, and
then we’ll turn back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lowered the speed, and they crawled
slowly along toward the trees he had indicated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s perfect,” sighed Patty, drinking in the
beauty all around her. “I’m glad you helped
me guess those questions, or I never should have
had this experience. Except for one moonlight
night in Venice, I’ve never seen anything so
lovely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you’re glad I brought you, if it <span class='it'>was</span> a
case of kidnapping?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Patty, while a demure smile dimpled
at the corners of her mouth. “I think
I like being kidnapped. Are you going to hold
me for ransom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to, but nobody could offer a ransom
big enough to get you back!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now <span class='it'>that’s</span> a pretty speech;” and Patty
nodded her head approvingly. “So, as there’s
no ransom to be considered, please take me back
to my fond parents, for I have no doubt they’re
scared to death wondering where I am.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:0.9em;'>PATTY’S INGENUITY</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philip turned the car around, and, in a
few moments, they were swiftly speeding
toward home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s awfully good of you,” he said, “to
give me this little bit of your time all to myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think I gave it,” observed Patty,
smiling; “I think you took it when I wasn’t
looking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and when no one else was looking, or
I mightn’t have succeeded so well. But it’s
been a gorgeous ride, and now I’m going to
take you right back to home and mother. Do
you suppose those people who went to see the
ocean are still looking at it? If so, it will be
fun to drive right down to them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, don’t try it! Camilla cuts up dreadfully
if she gets stuck in the sand. It’s the one
thing she won’t stand!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, we’ll go right, straight, bang
home, then. Whew! We have come farther
than I thought! We can’t see the lights of
Spring Beach yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; but I know where we are. It’s about
three miles to Spring Beach. Put on a good
speed, and we’ll soon do it. There’s not a
thing in the road, and I’ll trust your fast driving.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, my lady; here goes!” Van Reypen
flung in the highest speed and they fairly
flew. And then, quite suddenly and without
any jar or jolt, or warning of any kind, they
found themselves sitting quite still. Camilla
had stopped of her own accord, and seemed
absolutely disinclined to proceed. There was
no noise and no fuss, the car simply stood
motionless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you stop for?” asked Patty, turning
an enquiring face toward Van Reypen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t stop; she stopped herself. Your
friend Camilla is not in such haste to get home
as you are, and she wants to see the moonlight
on the sea once again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense! Didn’t you truly stop the car?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, truly I didn’t, and, what’s more, I can’t
make it go on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then something has happened!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right-o! How clever of you to guess that!
But it’s your car, and you know its tricks and
its manners. What does it mean when she stops
like this, gently but firmly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know;” and Patty looked blankly bewildered.
“She’s never done such a thing
before. Of course something must be out of
order,—but I can’t think what. The tires are
all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, of course; it isn’t a puncture. But I
can’t think myself what it can be. Well, I’ll
have to overhaul the engine and see what I can
see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Van Reypen got out and began to investigate,
but he could find nothing wrong in any part.
“Has the charge given out?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, the batteries are all right. It was fully
charged this morning, and I used it very little
to-day. She’s good for eighty or ninety miles
easily, and I haven’t run twenty to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, I give it up. I do know something
about cars, but I’m much more experienced with
the gasoline motors. However, this is so beautifully
made, and yet so really simple of construction,
that I feel I ought to understand it.
You get out, and take a look.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philip held the lamp while Patty peered
anxiously into the motor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She didn’t understand fully all the complicated
parts, but she had a fair working knowledge
of its main principles, and she, too, was unable
to discover anything wrong or out of order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re in a lovely mess,” she observed, cheerfully,
as she stood looking at Philip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, we’re up against it,” he rejoined, but
his tone was as cheerful as her own, and they
both laughed as they looked at each other.
For, given a moonlight night, and two merry
young people, it is not difficult to look on the
bright side of a motor misfortune.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” said Patty, philosophically, “what do
we do next?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not very familiar with this locality, but,
if there were any chance of a big car coming
along, we’d ask them to tow us. The running
gear of this car is all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and so is the steering gear. And the
batteries seem to be in perfect order. I can’t
imagine what’s the matter. However, I can
inform you there’s precious little chance of any
car coming along this way now. Seashore people
always go to bed early, and they never ride
at night, anyhow. No, we’ll have to walk
home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And leave the car here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; I hate to do it. But nobody can steal
her, for she won’t go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But somebody might steal her and tow her
away. That is, if a car <span class='it'>should</span> come along, and
we weren’t here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I can’t bear to think of that! I don’t
want to lose my beautiful car! What can we
do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see anything to do but to sit here
in the car all night, and of course we can’t do
that. Nor can one of us go and one stay, for
I wouldn’t let you go alone, and I’m sure I
wouldn’t let you stay here alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I’ll go,” said Patty, slowly. “You
stay with the car, and I’ll walk home alone.
It’s only three miles, and I’m sure it’s perfectly
safe; there’s no one abroad at this time of
night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty, I can’t let you do it;” and Philip Van
Reypen looked deeply troubled. “I can’t let
you walk those three miles, alone, late at
night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you don’t want to go and leave me
here, sitting alone in a broken-down motor
car?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; I can’t do that, either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And we can’t both go,—and we can’t both
stay! So it’s a dead—what do you call those
things?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A deadlock?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that’s what I mean. If neither of us
can go, and neither of us can stay, and we can’t
both go, and we can’t both stay, isn’t that a
pretty good imitation of a deadlock?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It certainly is! Now, in those lovely motor car
novels that people write, somebody would
come along just in the nick of time, and fix
everything all right, and we’d all live happy
ever after.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; but we’re not in a novel, and I’m positive
nobody will come along so late. What
time is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little after eleven,” said Philip, looking
at his watch. “Patty, I can’t tell you how
sorry I am that I got you into this scrape, and
I must figure some way to get you out! But it
hasn’t come to me yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philip’s face was a picture of despair. He
suddenly realised his responsibility in bringing
Patty out here at night. It was done on a
sudden impulse, a mere frolicsome whim, and,
if the car hadn’t broken down, all would have
been well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t take it too seriously, Philip,” said
Patty, in a pleading voice, for, now that she
saw how he felt, she was sorry for him. “We’ll
get out of this somehow! But, truly, I think
the only way is for me to walk home and send
father’s big car back for you and Camilla. I
sha’n’t mind the walk half as much as I
should mind sitting here, and waiting while you
go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Patty, you can’t walk three miles in
those little, high-heeled slippers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty looked down at her little evening shoes,
with their French heels. They were not suitable
for a three-mile walk, but that was a secondary
consideration. “I <span class='it'>must</span> go,” she said; “there
is no other way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’m going with you,” declared Philip,
stoutly. “And, if anybody steals that car, I’ll
give you another one exactly like it! I’ll have
it built to order, with the same specifications!
This whole affair is my fault, and I’m going to
get you out of it the best way I can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t your fault! I won’t have you say
so, just because that stupid old car chose the
worst possible moment to break down! But,
all the same, I don’t know how I can walk
three miles in these high-heeled slippers with
you any better than I could without you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philip grinned. “When you get tired, I’ll
carry you,” he declared. “I tell you I’m going
to get you out of this scrape, if it takes all
summer!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it will, unless we start pretty soon.
Come on, then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a minute. Suppose I take those heels
off your shoes. Couldn’t you walk better
then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, fiddlesticks! I’m accustomed to high
heels. I can walk in them all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; and, first thing you know, they’ll throw
you, and you’ll twist your foot, and sprain your
ankle——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then you <span class='it'>will</span> have to carry me,” said
Patty, laughing. “But, before we start, do
let’s try once more to make the car go. Maybe
it’s nothing but perverseness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But their efforts were unavailing, and Camilla
stood stock-still in the middle of the road, as
if she never intended to move again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be like the One-Hoss-Shay,” said
Patty, “only in that, you know, every part
dropped to pieces; and here nothing’s the matter
with any part.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there <span class='it'>must</span> be something the matter,”
declared Philip, who was once again examining
the batteries; “and, by jingo, Patty,—I’ve
found it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have! What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, the battery strap has separated, that’s
all!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the battery strap? I don’t see any
strap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it isn’t a leather strap; it’s this band
of lead that goes around the battery, but they
call it a strap. See this crack across it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that little crack! Does that do any
harm?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes, of course; it completely stops the
current. You see, the two ends of the strap
almost touch; if they did touch, we’d be all
right. Now, if I had a little piece of lead to
connect those two parts where they are separated,
I could fix it in a jiffy! Got any lead?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. Look in the tool-box.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just a little piece of lead wire, or anything
that’s lead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Try a lead pencil,” said Patty, but Philip
was poking in the tool-box and paid little attention
to her mild joke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There isn’t a lead thing here!” he exclaimed.
“Your tool-box is too everlastingly cleared up!
Every tool in a little pocket by itself! Why
don’t you have a whole lot of old rubbishy
junk; then we might find something for an
emergency?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you find anything that will do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a thing! To think that, now we’ve
found out what the trouble is, we can’t mend
it! and such an easy break to mend, if I just had
a scrap of lead. Well, we may as well make up
our minds to walk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, dear!” sighed Patty; “I didn’t mind
walking so much when I thought the car had
really broken down. But just that little bit
of a crevice in the battery strap! Oh, can’t
we mend it, somehow? Can’t you pull the strap
out longer or something?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, angel child, there’s nothing doing without
some lead. After this, always bring some
lead in your pocket.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I haven’t any pocket.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, that explains the absence of the lead!
If you had had a pocket, of course you would
have brought some lead. You’re excused.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, next time I’ll bring lead with me, you
may be sure of that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you will, fair lady, and may I be here
to use it! Now, shall we start for our moonlight
stroll?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a minute; I have a idea!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something tells me your idea is a good one!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know whether it is or not. I’m
afraid it isn’t. And I’m afraid to tell you what
it is, for fear you’ll laugh at me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I laugh? I, a man in charge of a broken-down
motor, and a fair young girl with French
heels, and midnight drawing nearer and nearer!
<span class='it'>I</span> laugh! Nay, nay, I’m in no laughing mood!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if you’ll promise not to laugh, I’ll tell
you,—or, rather, I’ll show you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From a little utility case, which was tucked
away under the seat of the motor, Patty drew
out a good-sized package of sweet chocolate.
“I always carry chocolate with me,” she
said, “because it tastes so good when it’s
dusty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When the chocolate’s dusty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, of course not; when the road’s dusty,
and your throat’s dusty,—chocolate’s awful
good then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she talked, Patty had torn off the outer
wrapper, and showed the chocolate neatly
wrapped in tinfoil. She took this off carefully,
and, tossing the chocolate aside, folded the tinfoil
into a long strip, while Philip gazed at her
with dawning admiration in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s your lead,” she said, simply, as she
handed him the strip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty, you’re a genius!” he exclaimed; “a
perfect genius! How did you <span class='it'>ever</span> think of
that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will it do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do? Of course it will do! It’s just the
very thing. I’ll wrap it around that separated
battery strap, and we’ll be off in two minutes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In really less than two minutes, Van Reypen
had wound the strip of tinfoil in its place, had
jumped into the car beside Patty, who was already
in, and they were flying along at top
speed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How <span class='it'>did</span> you think of it?” he asked again,
as they skimmed along. “It was terribly clever
of you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I knew you wanted lead, and I knew
tinfoil was lead. I was stupid not to think of
it sooner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a marvel to think of it at all! It was
wonderful!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, not at all; that’s nothing to what I can
do when I really try! Have some chocolate?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty was in gay spirits now, for they were
flying homeward through the moonlight, and
she was spared the three-mile walk and her beloved
car was safe in her own possession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I will have some chocolate, thank you.
We may as well take all the goods the gods
provide, while we can. I’m glad to get you
home safely, but I can’t honestly say that I
haven’t enjoyed this whole escapade. Can
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Patty, looking at him with a demure
smile, “not <span class='it'>honestly</span>, I can’t. But, all the
same, I’m glad we could manage to ride home
instead of walk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, so am I; and it’s astonishing how hungry
I am! Can you spare a little more of that
chocolate?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed;” and Patty broke off a generous
bit; “but we’ll give you some supper at
‘The Pebbles.’ I fancy they’ll be rather glad
to see us!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Philip, grinning; “and I rather
fancy we’ll get a warm reception,—and I’m not
sure but we deserve it!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span><h1>CHAPTER XIV</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:0.9em;'>A BIRTHDAY BREAKFAST</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not quite twelve o’clock when the
Swift Camilla swung through the gateway
of “The Pebbles,” and around the long
drive to the house. As might have been expected,
the waiting group on the veranda
greeted the returned runaways with various but
vociferous exclamations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several of them said, “Why, Patty Fairfield!”
Several others said, “Where have you
been?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roger called out, cheerily: “You must have
had a ripping good time! Wish I’d been
along!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Fairfield said only, “Patty!” and Mr.
Hepworth said nothing at all, but looked at
Patty with an unmistakable expression of reproof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philip Van Reypen took the brunt of the situation
upon himself. He jumped out of the car,
assisted Patty out, and led her straight to her
father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Fairfield,” he said, “here’s your daughter,
safe and sound, I’m happy to say. But I
want you to decorate her with the Victoria
Cross, or something just as good, for to-night
she has proved herself a genius,—a wonderful
genius! But for her ingenuity we should still
be sitting in her little motor car, high and dry
on a moonlit beach, listening to the wild waves.
To her all the honour and glory, and, if there is
any blame attached to our little excursion, it
is mine. I kidnapped your daughter, but I fully
meant to return her in ten or fifteen minutes,
without ransom. I am no villain! But, owing
to an accident, we were delayed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think you were!” broke in Mr.
Fairfield. “It is nearly midnight, and I
am——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Papa,” interrupted Patty, “I know exactly
what you are! You are surprised, astounded,
amazed, astonished, dumfounded, taken aback,
struck all of a heap, and completely flabbergasted!
If you are anything else, you can
let me know to-morrow. Meantime, we are
two heroes, who returned with our shield, and
on it, both! Incidentally we are starving, and,
if we had some supper, we could relate our experiences
in fine shape.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty’s arms were round her father’s neck, and,
with a wheedlesome expression, her eyes looked
up into his, and somehow Mr. Fairfield’s indignation
melted away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty’s quite right,” declared Nan, taking
sides with the culprits. “Let’s all go to the
dining-room, and then later we’ll hear about
Patty’s heroism.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Van Reypen was just as much of a
hero as I,” declared Patty, as, with her arm
tucked through her father’s, she led the way
to the dining-room, where a dainty little supper
had been waiting for the return of the missing
ones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It really wasn’t a matter of heroics,” said
Philip Van Reypen; “it was only a simple,
plain, everyday breakdown, caused by a separated
battery strap. But the glorious part of
it all was Miss Fairfield’s cleverness in finding
a remedy for the trouble, when it seemed at
first there was absolutely none.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, while they ate salad and sandwiches,
the interested audience listened to a
full description of the breakdown, told in Philip
Van Reypen’s most graphic style. In no way
did he try to evade the blame for the escapade;
he frankly admitted that he ought not to have
taken Patty off without permission, but so winning
was his frank manner, and so gleeful his
enjoyment of the whole recital, that he won the
sympathy of all present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all right, Philip, my boy,” declared Mr.
Fairfield, heartily. “I don’t blame you a bit
for yielding to the temptation to slip out of the
gate, and of course you could not foresee that
peculiar accident. And I am proud of my girl
for thinking of a way to fix the thing up! Tinfoil!
Well, well! I doubt if I should have
thought of that myself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty smiled and dimpled at the praises showered
upon her from all sides, and she caught
an approving smile from Mr. Hepworth, which
showed his appreciation of what she had done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’m very sorry to have failed in my duty
as hostess,” she said, demurely. “Did you
manage to get along without me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I was here,” said Nan, gaily, “and I
kept the young people in order.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We did have a lovely time, Patty,” said
Elise; “the walk along the beach was delightful;
wasn’t it, Christine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” replied Christine, slowly; “I never
saw anything like it. I didn’t know there was
so much beauty in the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Hepworth smiled at the rapturous expression
on the face of the Southern girl; and
then he declared that it was quite time he and
Mr. Van Reypen should depart for their own
domicile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you’re to come back here to-morrow
morning for breakfast,” said Nan, hospitably.
“We’ll breakfast at nine, and inaugurate
Patty’s birthday, which I can assure you is going
to be a pretty busy day for all concerned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s lovely to have a birthday,” sighed
Patty as, a few moments later, she went up the
broad staircase with her arms around Elise and
Christine, who were on either side of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And this is such a lovely continuous performance,”
said Elise. “We’ve had a lot of fun
already, and the birthday isn’t really begun
yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it has really begun,” said Patty, “because
it’s after midnight, and so it’s already
to-morrow; but we won’t have any more celebration
until breakfast is ready. So good-night,
girls, and be sure to be up on time for my birthday
breakfast.”</p>

<hr class='tbk104'/>

<p class='pindent'>The girls obeyed this parting injunction, but
Patty herself overslept, and it was half-past
eight in the morning when she opened her eyes
to find her two girl friends hovering over her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wake up, sleepy-head!” said Elise, pulling
Patty’s curls. “I say, Patty, how jolly it is
for you to sleep out here! But don’t you almost
freeze?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, indeed! I have so much bed-covering
that I sleep warm as toast; but I love to
feel the sea air blow on my face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty’s sleeping veranda was almost like a
room. Partially enclosed on three sides, the
front was open to the sea. There were broad
wicker blinds to be drawn at will, but, unless in
case of a very strong sea breeze, they were seldom
drawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls were in their kimonos, and Patty sent
them flying as she sprang up herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on, you two, and finish dressing; I’ll be
ready before you are, now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elise and Christine scampered away, and Patty
began to dress with all speed. And by nine
o’clock she went downstairs, fresh and dainty,
in a white, embroidered muslin frock, with knots
of light-blue ribbon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elise and Christine also wore white <span class='it'>lingerie</span>
dresses; Elise’s being much befrilled and
adorned, while Christine’s was far more simple.
But each was suited to the type of girl
who wore it, and when Nan appeared, also in a
white gown, it was a picturesque quartette that
stood on the veranda looking at the sunlit sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here they come!” cried Elise, as Mr. Hepworth
and Mr. Van Reypen appeared round the
corner. “And, Patty, see! They’re bringing
presents to you! Just look at their arms full
of tissue paper!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sure enough, both the men carried large parcels
elaborately done up in tissue paper and
bright ribbons. They came up laughing, and
with merry birthday greetings to the queen of
the occasion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Breakfast is ready,” said Nan. “We were
just waiting for you. Bring those impressive-looking
paper affairs with you, to the table;
there’s quite a collection there already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, indeed, there was! The whole party
took their seats at the large round table, and
at Patty’s place was a veritable mountain of
white-wrapped parcels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m overcame!” she exclaimed. “It’s quite
enough to have all you lovely people come to
visit me, without having gifts besides!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do open them, Patty!” cried Elise. “I’m
crazy to see what they are!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just for that I’ll open yours first, Elise,”
said Patty, laughing. “Which is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This one,” replied Elise, touching a large
parcel; “and it’s perfectly heavenly, Patty! I
did it, every stitch, myself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did every stitch of mine, too,” murmured
Roger, “if that makes a present more acceptable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty untied Elise’s gift, and it proved to be
an embroidered muslin hat, very frilly as to
brim, and ornamented with tiny, pink-satin rose-buds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How lovely!” cried Patty. “Thank you,
a thousand times, Elise. The idea of your making
those billions of stitches for poor, wuthless
me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t you make one for me?” asked
Kenneth, “if it’s a mark of such devoted friendship?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll make you two,” declared Elise, with a
smiling glance at him. “Put it on, Patty; let’s
see how it looks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Patty put on the pretty frilled hat, and
it formed a most appropriate frame around her
golden halo of hair, and her flushed rose-leaf
face. She had never looked prettier, and everybody
present gave back an answering smile to
the dancing eyes and dimpled mouth that challenged
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philip Van Reypen said, “By Jove!” under
his breath, and Roger, who overheard, murmured,
“Yes, and then some!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Patty unwrapped her other gifts.
Christine’s came next, and it was a beautiful
water colour of her own, in a simple, appropriate
frame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s exquisite, Christine dear,” said Patty,
“and I just love it! How you are getting on!
This is a real work of art, isn’t it, Mr. Hepworth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is truly good work,” replied Gilbert Hepworth,
and the approving glance he gave Christine
brought the colour to her cheeks, and made
her drop her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t tell her how lovely it is,” said Patty,
laughing; “Christine can’t stand praise in public.
Wait till I get you alone, girlie, and then
you’ll see if I have a grateful nature!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, open mine next!” cried Roger. “If
you’re going to take us apart and tell us of
your gratitude alone, I want to go right
now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t,” said Patty. “You have to be
thanked right before all the rest of the people!
But this is great! You know I love these crazy
things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty had opened Roger’s gift, and it was a
grotesque bronze figure, representing some
strange Japanese god. It was fascinating in its
very ugliness, and was a really beautiful specimen
of Japanese craft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not eating any breakfast, Patty,” said
Mr. Hepworth, suddenly. “Let me undo the
next parcel, while you try some of this delicious
omelette. I can vouch for its quality.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Patty, “I <span class='it'>am</span> starving. And
as a reward of merit, Mr. Hepworth, I’ll let
you untie your own gift.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good! I love to be in the limelight! Now
this is mine, and may you enjoy it many times
when I am far away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Mr. Hepworth displayed a very beautiful
and complete automobile lunch basket, with
fittings for two. It was of the finest design
and workmanship, and the appointments were
of the newest and best.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just what I want!” cried Patty. “Now
I can go out for a whole-day picnic. And it’s
such a lovely picnic basket! Mr. Hepworth,
you do think of the loveliest things!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The grateful glance that Patty gave him was
met by one equally friendly, and, in order to
escape drawing further attention to himself,
Mr. Hepworth quickly opened the next parcel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This proved to be Philip Van Reypen’s gift,
and, as it was being opened, he said: “I, too,
should have liked to bring you a really worthwhile
gift; but I felt, Miss Fairfield, that I’m
too much of a stranger to indulge in anything
but the conventional ‘books, candy, or flowers.’
So I have brought you only a box of candy, but
I hope you will have many happy returns of
to-day, when I shall be an old friend, and can
give you anything I choose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked enviously at the other men present,
who had known Patty so much longer than he
had; but, when his box of candy was finally
released from its wrappings, everybody exclaimed
in admiration. For it was by no means
a simple box, but was really a French jewel case,
whose various compartments were lined with
tufted blue satin, and, though now filled with
bonbons, were intended to hold trinkets. The
outside was of French brocade, decorated with
gold filigree and tiny French flowers. Altogether
it was an exquisite piece of handicraft,
and yet Mr. Van Reypen had, after all, only
presented the conventional “box of candy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan was greatly pleased at his cleverness. She
had liked Philip Van Reypen from the first, and
he had proved himself a cultured and intelligent
gentleman in every respect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kenneth’s gift was a fan; a point-lace mount,
with pearl sticks. He had showed taste in the
selection, and Patty was greatly pleased with
it. Indeed, she was enraptured with all her
lovely gifts, and fairly bubbled over with enthusiastic
thanks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is my present, Patty,” said Nan, producing
a very long box. “It was too big to
put on the table with the others, so please accept
it, with the wish that it may prove useful
some day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The long box contained a white-lace parasol,
which was just the thing to be carried with
Patty’s pretty summer costumes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Nan, what a duck you are!” she cried.
“I suppose this is from you and father both, as
I don’t see anything else from him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so, not so, my child,” said Mr. Fairfield,
taking a small box from his pocket. “On your
nineteenth birthday I want to give you a gift
all by myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He handed Patty the box, and in it was a pearl
ring. It was a beautiful pearl, and not too large
for a young girl to wear. Everybody admired
it, and Patty slipped it on her finger, and then,
holding her lace parasol open above her head,
she fanned herself with Kenneth’s fan. As she
still wore Elise’s embroidered hat, she made a
pretty picture of a typical summer girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look like a girl on a calendar,” said
Roger; “rather fussily gotten up, but picturesque
in a way!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all laughed at Roger’s speech, which
really fitted the case, and then, breakfast being
over, they gathered up Patty’s treasures and
adjourned to the hall.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span><h1>CHAPTER XV</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:0.9em;'>A MORNING SWIM</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” said Nan, “we must lay our plans.
We’re going to celebrate Patty’s birthday,
all day long; but there isn’t very
much time in a day, after all, so you must all
choose what you think would be the most fun
to do. We’re going to the Country Club for
luncheon, which is a motor trip of about twenty
miles. Then we’ll come back, and this evening
there will be a little dinner dance, which is,
of course, the real birthday party. Now you’ve
about two hours before we start this morning.
What do you want to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m for a dip in the ocean,” declared
Philip Van Reypen. “Does that hit anybody
else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me!” exclaimed Roger, and, “Me, too,”
declared Elise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d love to bathe,” said Christine, “if it isn’t
too cold. Is the water chilly, now, Patty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a little,” admitted Patty; “at least,
it was day before yesterday. I haven’t been in
since. But to-day is a whole lot warmer. I
don’t believe it will be too cold, Christine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s all go in,” proposed Elise, “and then,
if it is too chilly, we can turn around and come
right out again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This plan suited, and the girls ran away for
their bathing suits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty’s was white, trimmed with light blue,
and was exceedingly becoming. Her gold curls
were tied up in a light-blue silk handkerchief,
from which a few ringlets persisted
in escaping, though she kept tucking them
back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let them hang down, Patty,” said Roger;
“the salt water won’t take the curl out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Patty, laughing, “it makes it curl
tighter than ever!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I envy you that,” said Christine. “I always
wanted curly hair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You needn’t,” said Patty. “Your soft, sleek
bands are much better suited to your face than
my corkscrews would be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Hepworth laughed at this, for Patty’s
curls when wet turned into veritable corkscrews,
which hung from her temples like those of an
old-fashioned belle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christine’s rather plain bathing suit was of
navy blue, trimmed with white braid, but Elise
was gorgeous in a suit of scarlet and black, with
her hair tied up in a red bandanna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan’s suit was entirely of black, and was both
pretty and becoming; and, as Mr. Van Reypen
surveyed the group, he said: “Well, you <span class='it'>are</span> a
bunch of naiads! You look like one of
Sorolla’s pictures, except that we haven’t any
of his pumpkin-coloured light and purply-green
shadows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m!” commented Hepworth; “much you
know about Sorolla’s work, if you express it in
those terms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you see I’m not an artist,” said Van
Reypen, for Mr. Hepworth’s tone was so good-natured
he couldn’t feel annoyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who can swim?” Philip went on. “I’m
for a long dash out to that farthest buoy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can swim,” returned Patty, “but I won’t
go as far out as that buoy. I’ll swim part
way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, then;” and the two splashed into
the breakers. Patty was a good swimmer, and
there was not much surf that morning, so she
had no trouble in keeping up with Philip for
a fairly good distance. Then she said: “Now
I’m going to turn back, Mr. Van Reypen. I’ve
learned by experience that it is better to turn
back while we can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Van Reypen looked at her reproachfully as
they swam slowly side by side. “You called
me Philip, last night,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it;” and Patty smiled roguishly;
“but, you see, that was under stress of a great
emergency. I scarcely realised what I was doing,—and
I hope you’ll forgive me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll forgive you only on condition that you
never call me Mr. Van Reypen again, and that
you give me permission to call you Patty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t you demanding a great deal?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I am, indeed; but you are so generous-minded
that I have a hope of your consent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll race you to shore for it,” said Patty.
“If you win, first names go; if I win, we shall
continue with the more formal names.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right; it’s an unfair advantage, but I’m
going to take it. Of course, I can beat you
swimming to shore, but I’ll lag behind a little,
and let you think you’re winning, and then pass
you with a grand finish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know!” said Patty, teasingly,
and then they both headed toward shore and
swam rapidly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he had proposed, Philip kept a few lengths
behind her, meanwhile gasping and shouting
that he was almost exhausted, and that he feared
he could never reach land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty knew this was merely joking, and that
soon, with a few strong strokes, he would pass
her and come in a long distance ahead. But
she had no intention of being beaten so easily.
When nearly halfway to land, she saw Kenneth
swimming toward her. As they met, she
said, “Turn round and swim with me, Ken;
quick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did so, and Patty went on, talking rapidly:
“I want you to do something for me, Ken.
Let me go on, and you turn and delay Mr. Van
Reypen. I don’t care what you do,—talk to
him, duck him, or tease him in any way,—but
somehow or other keep him back until I reach
shore, and don’t let him know you’re doing it
purposely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, count on me;” and Kenneth turned,
and circled leisurely around, until he came face
to face with Philip Van Reypen. “Hello!” he
said. “You’re a ripping good swimmer! I
want to show you a new stunt I learned lately.
Mighty few could appreciate it, as I know you
can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some other time, Harper,” hastily spoke Mr.
Van Reypen. “I want to speak to Miss Fairfield
just now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, she won’t mind,” said Kenneth, taking
care to keep directly in Van Reypen’s way.
“You see, you start sideways and then——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I say, Harper, wait till some other time!
Let me pass, please. I’ll be back in ten minutes,
and glad to learn your new trick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you needn’t be stuffy about it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m not stuffy, my boy, only——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’ll show you now. You see, you swim
on one side;” and, before Van Reypen realised
what was happening to him, Kenneth had
grasped his arm and gently but steadily pushed
him around until he was headed out to sea
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this moment Patty reached the beach, as
Kenneth saw out of the corner of his eye, and,
suddenly changing his tone, he said: “By
George! Van Reypen, I believe you were in
earnest! In that case, I’m sorry I insisted. Of
course, I’ll teach you the trick some other time!
Go ahead, if you want to speak to Miss Fairfield.
She’s right over there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus disarmed, Philip couldn’t answer Kenneth
angrily, and, suppressing his chagrin, he
said: “All right, old chap, and thank you.
We’ll go for a swim together, to-morrow morning,
and then I’ll be glad to learn your new
stunt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kenneth felt a little ashamed of his subterfuge,
for he was of a frank, honest nature. But
he had done it for Patty, and he felt sure that
the whole thing was some merry jest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Freed from his tormentor, Van Reypen struck
out swiftly for the shore, and the next moment,
throwing himself on to a big breaker, he
was washed up on the beach at Patty’s side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you do, Mr. Van Reypen?” said
that mischievous damsel, smiling at him under
her corkscrew curls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wasn’t fair!” growled Philip; “I was
delayed. Harper stopped me, and I couldn’t
get away from him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’s a pretty excuse,” chaffed Patty.
“I heard you say that you were almost exhausted
and out of breath, and you <span class='it'>were</span> puffing
like a whale!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that was mere foolery! I didn’t mean
a word of it! I’m not a bit blown. I could
swim for miles!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That all sounds very well, but I think you’ll
have to admit that I won the race.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The race is not always to the swift,—but
I admit gracefully that you did reach the beach
first, and I herewith relinquish all hope of ever
being allowed the privilege I had requested.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, don’t give up too easily!” said Patty,
though she well knew that his speech was not
made in earnest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come along, Patty!” cried Nan. “Unless
you want to go motoring in a wet bathing suit,
you must scamper into some dry clothes. Come
along with us, we’re all going now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crowd of bathers dispersed, and, as there
was need for expedition, in less than a half an
hour they reassembled, clad in civilian’s garb
and all ready for the picnic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls’ light frocks were covered with voluminous
motor-coats, and they all wore pretty
motor-hoods or bonnets of soft-coloured silks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three cars were necessary to accommodate the
luncheon party, and it was quite a gala procession
that started from “The Pebbles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>First was Mr. Fairfield’s own big car, driven
by Miller, and containing Mr. Fairfield and
Nan, Christine and Mr. Hepworth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was followed by a runabout, which Mr.
Fairfield had engaged for the occasion, and
which was driven by Roger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This car held two in front, with a small rear
seat for another. Philip Van Reypen sat next
to Roger, and Elise sat alone in the small back
seat, saying she had always wanted to try such
a position, but had never before had opportunity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hang on, then, Sis,” warned Roger, as they
started, “for I don’t want to stop and run back
to pick you up all the time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No danger,” said Elise, merrily; “but it is
fun! I feel like an enthroned princess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look like one, too,” said Van Reypen,
getting in beside Roger; “and we are your
two Gold-sticks in Waiting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Swift Camilla brought up the rear of the
procession, and in it were Patty and Kenneth.
Kenneth had begged for this arrangement, as
he said he had not yet had a ride in Patty’s
new car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither have I,” declared Mr. Hepworth,
and, after a moment’s consideration, Patty said
that she would take Kenneth half the way and
then exchange him for Mr. Hepworth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And nothing could be fairer nor that,” declared
Kenneth, as he accepted his fate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a perfect day for motoring—bright,
clear, and not too cool. Spring flowers were
in bloom in the gardens, and palms and shrubbery,
carefully kept, made the lawns picturesque.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ideal place to spend a summer,” said Kenneth
to Patty, as they flew along, “and great
roads for motoring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it is,” agreed Patty. “The others want
to go to the mountains in August, but I’m just
crazy to stay here all summer. Perhaps I can
persuade them to go off by themselves, and
leave me here. I could have some one to
chaperon me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you could; that would be gay. I
expect Aunt Rachel would come, if you wanted
her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s a dear old thing,—nobody I’d like
better! But I haven’t dared broach the subject
yet. Don’t say anything about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, I won’t. But I say, Patty, what
was that deal you had on with Van Reypen?
He was awful mad when I held him up out in
the water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it was nothing but foolishness!” said
Patty, laughing at the recollection. “I promised
him that, if he beat me to the shore, we’d
call each other by our first names,—otherwise
not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was a <span class='it'>nice</span> wager!” exclaimed Kenneth,
in disgruntled tones. “Why, Patty, you
don’t know that chap well enough to call him
by his first name!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense, Ken; I’m not grown-up and
formal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty laughed mischievously. “He is
grown-up, but he isn’t a bit formal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say not! I can tell you I
didn’t like the way he carted you off last
night!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Kenneth, what a goose you are! You
know the whole story of that performance. He
couldn’t help the strap breaking, and, if my father
didn’t bother about it, I don’t think you
need to!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the same as telling me it’s none of my
business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I didn’t mean it exactly that way, but,
all the same, it isn’t! Don’t you like Mr. Van
Reypen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I do; he’s a rattling good chap. But
I don’t want him coming down here and monopolising
you for motoring and swimming and
everything else. I s’pose you’ll give him every
other dance, to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty drew down the corners of her lips and
made a sobbing sound in her throat, as if she
were on the verge of bursting into tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“D-don’t sco-o-ld me, K-kenneth!” she
pleaded, in a voice which she meant to sound
tearful, but which was choking with laughter,
and didn’t fool Kenneth a bit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a little coquette, that’s what you are,
Patty; and I won’t stand it! I knew you long
before Van Reypen did, and he’s not going to
cut me out, I can tell you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good gracious, Kenneth! I should say he
wasn’t! Why, he’s only an acquaintance, and
you’re one of my oldest friends!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I am;” and Patty’s hearty tone
made Kenneth feel a little ashamed of his flash
of jealousy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, don’t let me hear any more such
foolish talk! Here I am taking you ridy-by in
my dear little car, and, instead of appreciating
it, you scold me all to pieces!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgive me, Patty; I am a brute. But
somehow Van Reypen has such a way with
him. He acts as if he owned you and this
car——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And ‘The Pebbles’ and father and Nan,”
supplemented Patty, going off into a peal of
laughter. “Well, Ken, I can’t see any way for
you to get even with him but to act as if you
owned us all yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t do it,” said Kenneth; “I haven’t that
arrogance of nature.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a pity!” said Patty, looking at him,
with laughing eyes.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='216' id='Page_216'></span><h1>CHAPTER XVI</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:0.9em;'>A CHANGE OF PARTNERS</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their foolish little squabble over, Patty
and Kenneth were as good chums as
ever, and they skimmed along in the
same satisfied friendliness they always felt when
together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All too soon, in Kenneth’s opinion, they had
traversed half their journey, and reached the
place where it had been arranged that Patty
was to change her companion and give Mr.
Hepworth his ride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big car was waiting for them as they
came along, and, though Kenneth said “Confound
it!” to Patty, under his breath, no one
else heard it, and he exchanged places with
Hepworth with a smiling, agreeable countenance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The transfer being effected, the two cars
started on again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty drove, and Mr. Hepworth watched her
with admiration and interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a wonderful child,” he said; “you
can do almost anything you turn your hand
to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, I can’t,” returned Patty; “I can’t
paint like Christine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, that’s a special talent of hers.
Your special talent is your singing. But I mean
you can do all sorts of other things, like guessing
puzzles and running motor cars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, so I can; but don’t forget that, if you
hadn’t guessed that last charade for me, and
an unfair one at that, I never should have
had this car. So you see the car is partly
yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ll take out my share in going riding
with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t you like to drive it yourself, some
day, Mr. Hepworth? You could take Christine
out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Christine! I’d rather take you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather take <span class='it'>me</span> than Christine Farley?”
Patty’s blue eyes opened wide, and it was plain
to be seen that her surprise at this statement
was unfeigned, and by no means a bit of coquetry.
But it piqued Gilbert Hepworth, and
he answered, a little shortly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know I would! Why do you pretend
otherwise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know any such thing! Christine is
your special friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And aren’t you my special friend?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, not exactly;” and Patty’s cheeks dimpled
as she smiled. “I’m your special friend’s
daughter. Isn’t daddy your special friend?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, of course;” and Mr. Hepworth looked
decidedly cross, as he always did when reminded
of the difference of age between himself
and Patty,—a thing which Patty never
seemed to forget.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But just now,” he went on, “you’re so
absorbed in your special friend, Van Reypen,
that you have no thought of anybody
else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the land’s sake!” exclaimed Patty;
“and that’s an expression I use only on the
strongest provocation! But I’ll tell you something,
Mr. Hepworth,”—and she looked at him
squarely,—“when Kenneth Harper was with
me just now, he held me up on account of what
he called my friendship for Mr. Van Reypen!
Now, if you’re going to do the same thing, I
give you fair warning, I’ll put you out and I’ll
take Philip Van Reypen in this car! So there,
now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Hepworth laughed at the flashing eyes,
and the rose-flushed cheeks that faced him, very
much like an angry kitten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgive us both, Patty,” he said, smiling
in spite of himself at the ridiculous situation.
“You see, the truth is Kenneth and I are both
jealous of your new friend. And you’ll probably
find that Roger is in the same unenviable
frame of mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fiddle-de-dee, and fiddlesticks, and fiddle-strings!”
exclaimed Patty; “you people all
make me tired, you do. As you know, I adore
all my friends, and I want them all to adore
me, and, when I make new friends, they’ve all
got to adore each other, too, and that’s all there
is about that! But don’t you worry over old
Roger. He’s fallen a victim to the charms of
Mona Galbraith. I never was so surprised in
my life! You know, I don’t like that girl very
much, and last night, as soon as Roger met her,
they immediately fell into a deep friendship!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you like her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, she isn’t exactly our sort. She’s a little
forward, a little pushing, and a little lacking
in certain varieties of good taste. But she’s
warm-hearted and generous, and, if she had had
proper training, would have been an awfully
nice girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you help her, Patty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Mr. Hepworth, I can; but I don’t want
to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you want to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only because I’m a horrid thing! I know
that, if I begin to help her, she’ll want to be
helped every minute in the day, and I’ll have my
hands full. I suppose I’m lazy and selfish, but
I do hate to take that girl’s bringing-up on my
shoulders.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t blame you altogether, Patty;” and
Gilbert Hepworth smiled at her gravely, yet
kindly. “But don’t you exaggerate a little bit?
I know what you mean. I saw last night what
insistent ways Miss Galbraith has, and I know
her demands on your time and attention would
be incessant. But, Patty, think how much you
have!—not only worldly goods, but love and
care and protection and interested sympathy.
Isn’t it your duty to do what you can for
this strange girl, thrown so definitely in your
way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She <span class='it'>is</span> in my way,” said Patty, pouting;
“very much so!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And do you realise,” went on Mr. Hepworth,
very seriously now, “that, just because
of all this love and praise and appreciation you
receive, you run a pretty strong chance of becoming
selfish and self-centred?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Hepworth! I do believe you are lecturing
me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s exactly what I’m doing. I’ve done
it before, and never has it failed to produce a
good effect. I’m very fond of you, Patty, as
you know perfectly well; and I cannot bear to
see your sunny and generous nature spoiled by
indolence or thoughtlessness on your part. Now
I’m going to drop this lecture right straight
now. I’ve said all that is necessary, and I know
it has sunk in your heart deeply, as I intended
it to. And I know that you will overcome your
dislike and disinclination for the work, but that
you will honestly and definitely try to do all
you can for that girl, and be all you can to
her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment Patty was silent, and then she
said, in a low voice: “You are right, Mr. Hepworth,
as you always are. I understand all you
have said, and all you have meant, and I make
you no promises; but I promise myself to do all
I can for Mona Galbraith, to help her in the
way she needs help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s my little trump!” exclaimed Mr.
Hepworth, in a voice which betrayed a thrill
of real emotion, and then he quickly changed
the subject and called Patty’s attention to a
picturesque bit of landscape in the middle distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rest of their ride they chatted in a lighter
key, with no reference to duty, and, when they
reached the Country Club, they were both
laughing merrily as they joined the rest of the
party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m as hungry as a hunter!” cried Patty,
springing from her car. “I wish I’d brought
Mr. Hepworth’s luncheon basket, well filled,
along with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll have luncheon enough, Puss,” said her
father, “and, as we’re a little later than I expected,
we’ll have it served right away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Country Club House was an elaborate
one, with broad verandas and large, high-ceilinged
halls and rooms. The walls bore the
usual decorations of antlers and other trophies
of the chase, and the appointments were luxurious
and comfortable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty had never been to just such a place before,
and was interested in it all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t we become members, father?” she
asked, as its plan and scope were explained to
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Next year, perhaps, my dear. But this summer
we’ll content ourselves with coming over
here occasionally, by the courtesy of my
friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Luncheon was served in a small dining-room,
which they had quite to themselves. The viands
were most attractive and proved more than acceptable
to the hungry motorists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After luncheon, they wandered about the beautiful
grounds, and some of them went for a
row on the lake, while some others had a short
game of tennis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty had such a good time that she was sorry
when her father called them to go home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We just fly from one kind of fun to another!”
exclaimed Elise, as they made ready
to start. “Mayn’t I ride home with you,
Patty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, Miss Farrington,” said Philip Van
Reypen, overhearing her; “it’s my turn to ride
with Miss Fairfield. We’re going to put you
and Mr. Harper in the roadster, with Mr. Hepworth
behind to see that you don’t fall out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As usual, Mr. Van Reypen’s audacity carried
the day; and, too, Elise had no objections to
driving home with Kenneth. This left Roger
and Christine to go in the big car with the
two elder Fairfields, and the arrangement was
fairly satisfactory all around.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, as Patty and Mr. Van Reypen were about
to start, Roger came up to speak to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must play fair and square, Patty,” he
said. “You divvied up the ride, coming over,
and you must do the same, going back. You
take Mr. Van Reypen as far as that halfway
place, and then you’ve got to exchange him for
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Roger, I will; it’s only fair that
all you boys should have a spin with Camilla
in turn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know,” said Philip Van Reypen,
as they sped away. “I don’t think you need
to change partners on this short trip.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“’Deed I will!” declared Patty. “I’ve had
enough of being scolded because I don’t play
fair. Now when we get to that halfway place,
you know where I mean, that tumble-down house
with the vines all over it, I’m going to put you
out and take Roger in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Philip, humbly. “But you
won’t do it until we do reach the tumble-down
old house, will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I won’t,” agreed Patty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a while, Philip asked that he be allowed
to drive, and, as Patty was quite willing
to be an idle passenger, they changed seats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry that I have to call you Miss Fairfield,”
said Philip, resignedly, as they were once
more spinning along. “It’s so formal it takes
away all the pleasure of our conversation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too bad,” said Patty, demurely; “but do
you know I rather like formality, Mr. Van
Reypen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad you do, Miss Fairfield. It’s a
charming day, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Mr. Van Reypen; delightful,” returned
Patty, and then the conversation lagged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to tell you something,” said Patty,
suddenly. “I don’t feel quite honest, and I
want to ’fess up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, Miss Fairfield?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, it’s just this. You know this morning,
when Kenneth delayed you, and you lost
our race?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I asked him to delay you, on purpose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You did? You little rascal! Why, that was
downright dishonesty! Aren’t you ashamed of
yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I am,” said Patty, hanging her head,
and looking like a lovely penitent. “Can you
ever forgive me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I never can!” Van Reypen’s tone was
very stern, and Patty was amazed at the serious
way he took what she thought was a joke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, truly! can’t you forgive me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! I <span class='it'>never</span> shall!” and he glared into
Patty’s upturned face with an expression so
savage that it suddenly dawned on Patty that
he was fooling, after all!</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a beseeching glance and a drooping
curve to her lips, Patty then murmured, in low
tones, “Can’t you ever forgive me,—Philip?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty! Of course I can! And there’s nothing
to forgive, you little rogue! But now you’re
going to call me Philip, all the time, aren’t
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thpothe I am,” said Patty, foolishly, and
in an idiotic tone, and then they both giggled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now can you be entertaining?” asked
Patty, briskly; “and not just sit up and remark
that it is a charming day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the day is more charming than ever!”
declared Philip. “And I must emphasise the
fact.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, goodness gracious me! wherever is that
halfway place? Have we passed the tumble-down
old house with vines clambering all over
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, we haven’t passed it yet,” said Philip,
innocently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We ought to reach it soon,—I’m sure it’s
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How complimentary you are! Does the way
seem so long?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It doesn’t seem so long, but it seems strange.
I don’t remember these houses. Did we pass
them on the way over?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must have been so busy driving the car
you didn’t see them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense! I’ve never been this way before
in my life! You’ve taken the wrong road, and
you’ve done it on purpose,—Philip!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I have, Patty! At least it’s a different
road, but it isn’t a wrong road. It’s just as
direct to ‘The Pebbles’ as the other road, but
it has the advantage of not passing by the clambering
house with the tumble-down vines!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you’ve done it, so we’d slip Roger!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I did! Clever of me, wasn’t it?
Oh, you haven’t the entire monopoly of clever
ideas, if you <span class='it'>did</span> mend your motor car with
chocolate!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philip was gleefully chuckling at his successful
ruse, and, when Patty realised that she
couldn’t help herself, she laughed, too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roger won’t mind, anyway,” she said; “he’s
such a good-natured old duck. And I’ll make
it up to him by taking him out for the whole
day to-morrow, on a picnic with my new lunch
basket. I’ve been wanting to try that lovely
basket, and see if it will carry a picnic for
two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philip’s face suddenly lost its jovial smile.
“There’ll <span class='it'>be</span> a ‘picnic for two,’ if you cut up
any such trick as that! And you and young
Farrington will see what kind of a picnic I
mean! Why, Patty, you’re hostess of this
house party of yours. You can’t desert all your
other guests,—and go skylarking off with only
one of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unless it’s you,” said Patty, with a demure
glance at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, unless it’s me,” said Philip, smiling
broadly.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:0.9em;'>A DINNER AND A DANCE</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Patty and Philip reached home,
a little later than the others, Roger
was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s Roger?” asked Patty, as she
jumped out of the car, for she wanted to make
peace with him at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s gone over to ‘Red Chimneys,’” said
Elise, laughing. “He’s taken a terrible fancy
to that Galbraith girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told you we needn’t mind about Roger,”
said Patty to Philip. “I’m glad he does like
Mona, though I confess I was a little surprised
at first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very soon Roger came back to “The Pebbles,”
bringing Mona with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, people!” the girl called out, as she
neared the veranda. “You kept terribly sly
about your birthday, didn’t you, Patty? But
Mr. Farrington told me last night, and father
telegraphed to New York for a present for me
to give you, and it’s just arrived by special
messenger. How do you like it?” and Mona
tossed a small box into Patty’s lap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The others crowded round to see, and Patty
opened the box, to find a beautiful jewel pendant
hung on a slender thread of a platinum
neck-chain. The pendant was a fair-sized
sapphire, surrounded by tiny diamonds, and
was of fine design and workmanship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mona! How lovely!” cried Patty. “But
I can’t accept such a valuable present from
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense! It’s a mere trinket. I’m delighted
to give it to you, and father was
delighted to get it for me, so you’ll simply have
to take it. I was only afraid you wouldn’t think
it pretty!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pretty? Why, it’s perfectly beautiful!”
and Patty clasped the chain around her neck
at once. She was a little uncertain how to
take the gift, but she could not so hurt Mona’s
feelings as to refuse it, and, if she accepted it,
she might as well do it gracefully. She cast an
enquiring glance at Nan, who, as usual, came
to her aid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a lovely present, Patty; and Mona is
most kind and generous to give it to you. I’m
sure we all appreciate it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus tacitly advised, Patty thanked Mona
prettily, and then Nan declared it was time to
think about dressing for dinner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re coming, Mona, aren’t you?” said
Patty, for she knew Nan had invited her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, indeed; I’ll be the first one here and
the last one to leave. Trust me for that!”
and, with a merry laugh, Mona ran away
across the two lawns to her own house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s all right!” said Roger, looking after
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, she is,” said Patty, generously; and,
indeed, Mona had risen in her estimation
since Roger showed such approval of
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then the group separated, to meet again
at the birthday dinner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three girls gathered in Patty’s room for
a short chat first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you going to wear, Patty?” asked
Elise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I have a new blue affair that’s perfectly
dear. What’s yours, Christine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“White,” said Christine, simply. “I can’t
wear many colours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t need to, you angel person,” said
Patty, kissing her. “You’ll look heavenly in
white. I’ve never seen you in evening dress.
It is evening dress, isn’t it, Christine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; that is, it’s a round neck, but it’s very
simple.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re simple yourself,” said Patty; “simply
sweet! Isn’t she, Elise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Patty’s delight to make Elise admire
Christine, and of course it wasn’t possible, when
thus appealed to, for Elise to do anything but
acquiesce in Patty’s opinion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now, honey, what’s your gorgeous
creation that’s to dazzle the eyes of the country
people down here?” said Patty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mine is green,” returned Elise; “and it’s
a good enough frock, but I know it won’t be
in it with yours, Patsy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense! It’s probably far handsomer.
Aren’t we all getting grown-up, to have dinner
parties and low-neck gowns! Though mine
isn’t exactly low neck, it’s just cut out sort of
round.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, a Dutch neck,” said Elise; “that’s what
mine is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But still it does seem grown-up,” went on
Patty, musingly, “to have a birthday dinner
and dance, instead of just an ordinary party.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you are grown-up when you’re nineteen,”
said Christine. “I’m twenty, and I think
I’m grown-up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s because you’re Southern,” said Patty.
“We stay little girls a lot longer up here. And
I’m glad of it, for I hate being grown-up. I
wish I could wear pig-tails and hair ribbons!
Anyway, I’m not going to act grown-up to-night;
my party’s going to be a frolic, not a formal
affair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How many are coming?” asked Christine,
who had not entirely overcome her shyness with
strangers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there’s about ten of our own crowd,
and Nan has invited about ten more of the
Spring Beach people. The two Sayre girls are
awfully jolly; you’ll like them. And Jack Pennington
is a dear boy, and so is Guy Martin.
And then there’s Dorothy Dennison and her
brother,—and Phyllis Norton,—oh, quite a
bunch of them! And, Christine, don’t you
go cutting up any of your shrinking violet
tricks! I want you to be the belle of the ball!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elise looked up in surprise, but, seeing the determined
expression on Patty’s face, she said
nothing; and, if she had her own opinion as to
who should be belle of the ball, she expressed
it only to herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour later, the three girls went downstairs
together. Patty in the middle, with her sky-blue
chiffon frock, was looking her best. The
pale blue suited her golden hair and pink
cheeks, and the semi-low-cut neck was exceedingly
becoming to her rounded throat and
chin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elise’s green dress was far more elaborate,
but her brilliant beauty seemed to call for an
ornate setting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christine’s gown was perhaps the prettiest of
all. Of white crêpe-de-chine, it hung in soft,
straight folds, and around the throat was a
delicate pearl embroidery. A girdle of pearl-work,
with long ends, gave a finishing touch;
and on Christine’s willowy figure, and with her
Madonna face, the gown was appropriate and
effective.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys, who were waiting in the hall, exclaimed
in vociferous compliment as the girls
came slowly down the staircase, and declared
that such a trio of beauty had never before
been seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense!” cried Patty. “Don’t you talk
to us as if we were grown-up young ladies!
We’re only a little bit more than schoolgirls.
Just because I’m nineteen, I’m not going to be
treated with dignity! Roger, will you dance
the first dance with me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roger looked embarrassed, and, though he
tried to speak, he hesitated and stammered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Patty,—that is,—I’d be only too delighted,—but——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you’ve already asked Mona!” cried
Patty, with a teasing laugh. “I knew it perfectly
well, Roger, and I only asked you to
tease you. And I’ll be perfectly content with
the second, so save that for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed I will, and thank you kindly,” said
Roger, and then Philip Van Reypen and Kenneth
both said at once, “May I have the first
dance, Patty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed,” she returned, laughing gaily at
them; “I’m not going to give my first dance
to any of my house party. There are several
Spring Beach boys coming, and I shall dance
with whichever one of those asks me first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty’s own particular decided wag of the
head accompanied this speech, and the men
knew it would be of no use to coax her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then the other guests began to arrive, and
the great entrance hall of “The Pebbles” was
a scene of merry laughter and chatter, and
greetings and introductions on all sides.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under Nan’s orders, the whole place had been
beautifully decorated. In the hall and rooms
were garlands and banks of flowers, and tall
palms shading alcoved nooks. The verandas
were hung with Japanese lanterns, and a few
of these were scattered among the shrubbery,
to light the way for any who might be inclined
to stroll on the lawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At eight o’clock, Patty, taking her father’s
arm, led the way to the dining-room. Nan
and Mr. Hepworth followed, and then the
others in merry procession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dinner was served at small tables, as the number
of guests was too large to be accommodated
at one. Each table was beautifully decorated
with flowers and candles, and pretty place-cards
as souvenirs of the occasion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course there was a birthday cake, and when
at last Patty cut it, and each guest had partaken
of it, the dinner was over, and the dance about
to begin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several musicians were on the broad landing,
halfway upstairs, and played just the right kind
of music for young people’s merry dancing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack Pennington asked Patty for the first
dance, and, a little to his surprise, she graciously
granted it. He had hardly hoped for this honour,
but he didn’t know that Patty had planned
it thus in order to avoid selecting one of her
house party in preference to the others. So
she danced with Jack Pennington, and afterward,
as they sauntered out on the veranda, all
the other men clustered around Patty, begging
for dances, until her programme was full, and
many of the dances had been divided. Of
course, as Patty was hostess, she would naturally
receive much attention, but her own
merry and charming personality made her
easily the most popular girl present, though
the others were almost equally so. Handsome
Elise was a general favourite, and Christine’s
delicate Southern beauty attracted many admirers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mona was resplendent in bright pink silk,
elaborately ornamented. She wore too many
jewels, as always, but her whole-souled, good-tempered
gaiety, and her hearty enjoyment of
the occasion, made her attractive to many.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a dance with Philip, Patty and he wandered
out on to the veranda, and sat for a moment
on the railing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beautiful show, Patty,” he said; “one of the
prettiest parties I ever saw. These lanterns are
gorgeous. Why don’t you keep them here all
the time? Sets off the house wonderfully.
Come down on the lawn for a little stroll.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid you’ll kidnap me,” said Patty,
mischievously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; honest I won’t. Though I’d like to.
Say, let’s get Camilla out, and go for a little
spin. Will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, I won’t! We got out of that other
scrape pretty well. But I’m not going to take
any chances again! Beside, the next dance is
Kenneth’s. I’d better get back where he can
find me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he’ll hunt you up, all right! Hello!
Who’s this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some one came running toward them through
the semi-darkness. It was Mona, out of breath
and laughing. “Hide me!” she cried. “Hide
me! I’m running away from Roger!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How extraordinary,” laughed Patty. “You
<span class='it'>are</span> a coquettish young thing, aren’t you,
Mona?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hide me, Patty,” urged Mona. “That’s a
dear. Let me get behind you two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mona slipped around behind Patty and Philip,
but, anxious to help her, Patty said: “Back into
the arbour, Mona; we’ll keep in front of you.
Hurry! here comes Roger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you seen Miss Galbraith?” asked
Roger, coming up to them, entirely unsuspicious
of Mona’s whereabouts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve just strolled out here,” said Patty,
innocently. “Why don’t you look on the
veranda, Roger? Does she know you’re looking
for her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course she does! On the veranda, you
say?” and Roger was off like a shot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty and Philip, stifling with laughter, turned
back to Mona, who stood with her finger on her
lips, cautioning silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as, in obedience to her gesture, they were
still, they all distinctly heard a voice speaking
on the other side of the arbour. The speaker
could not be seen, and the hearers had no intention
of eavesdropping, but it was Kenneth’s
voice, and his tone was tense and angry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tell you, Elise,” he said, “I don’t believe
Patty ever said that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She did,” said Elise, with the accent of one
who reiterates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Philip Van Reypen’s impulse to walk
round the arbour at once, and make their presence
known, but Patty silently put her hand on
his arm and led him toward the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mona followed, also silently, for she realised
at once that Patty was disturbed at what she
had heard. The words in themselves might
mean a mere trifle or nothing at all; but the
seriousness of Kenneth’s voice, and the petulant
insistence of Elise, seemed to forebode trouble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does it mean?” whispered Philip, as
they neared the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing,—nothing at all,” said Patty, but
she spoke in a low voice and her lip was quivering.
She had divined intuitively that Elise
had told Kenneth something to make him angry,
and she felt sure that Elise had done it purposely,
and that she had misrepresented the
facts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I take you into the house?” asked
Philip, gently. “I think you said your next
dance is Harper’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not just yet,” said Patty, who was so hurt
by Elise’s treachery that she could not fully control
her quivering lip and the tears that came
to her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mona had disappeared, and so Philip said,
“Let us stroll once more round the drive, and
then it will be all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice was so pleasant, and his manner so
quiet, that it acted as a balm to Patty’s shattered
nerves, and she looked up gratefully, and
smiled at him through two teardrops that trembled
in her blue eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re awfully good,” she said, “and I’m
not going to be silly. Never mind it. But
aren’t you engaged for this dance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, to Miss Galbraith,” he replied, smiling;
“but I feel quite sure she has forgotten
it in her game of hide-and-seek with young
Farrington.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you must go and find her, all the same,”
said Patty, suddenly mindful of etiquette.
“Come! let us hurry to the house. I’m all
right now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They quickened their pace, and Philip talked
with a cheery banter, so that, when they reached
the veranda, Patty was her own smiling, merry
self, and she felt profoundly grateful to Philip
because he had not again referred to the bit of
conversation they had overheard.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='242' id='Page_242'></span><h1>CHAPTER XVIII</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:0.9em;'>MONA INTERFERES</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty found Kenneth in the doorway,
awaiting her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here you are,” he called out, cheerily
enough, and Patty hoped it was only her
imagination that made her think his manner
a little constrained. He was gentle and kindly
as ever, but he was not in merry mood, and
Patty felt this at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They began to dance. Their steps suited perfectly,
and, though Patty herself was such an
accomplished dancer that she could adapt her
step to any one, yet she always specially enjoyed
a turn with Kenneth. But now he seemed different,
and, though he danced as perfectly as
usual, and so did Patty, there was a certain constraint
in his manner and he spoke only occasionally,
and then the merest commonplaces.
Patty realised fully that there was something
wrong, but she also knew she could do nothing
then and there to set it right. She couldn’t ask
Kenneth what Elise had said to him, and she
couldn’t think of any other way to open the
subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, after a few turns round the room, she was
really glad that another partner claimed her,
for this was one of the dances that she had
divided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kenneth left her, with a simple “Thank you,
Patty,” and, turning on his heel, went out of
the dancing-room. In the hall he met Mona,
who said, abruptly and impulsively: “Oh, Mr.
Harper! I haven’t any partner for this dance.
Come for a walk round the lawn, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t you rather dance?” asked Kenneth,
who was in no mood for conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Mona, smiling wilfully, “I want
to walk out under the lanterns on the lawn.
They’re so lovely and Japanesy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mona had a wheedling way with her, and
Kenneth smiled a little as he escorted her down
the steps and along a side path through the
grounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think I’m a queer girl, don’t you, Mr.
Harper?” she began, as they strolled along under
the trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I did, you couldn’t expect me to tell you
so, Miss Galbraith,” he parried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, even if you haven’t thought so before,
you will now;” and Mona gave a determined
shake of her head. “But I don’t care if you
do. I want you to answer me a question. What
did Miss Farrington tell you that Patty Fairfield
had said, and you returned that you didn’t
believe Patty said it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Kenneth was an exceedingly well-mannered
young man, but he was certainly taken
aback by this question flung at him so suddenly
by a comparative stranger, and he was tempted
to reply so plainly that she must think him rude.
But, after a moment’s hesitation, he modified
his intentions, and only said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry to have you think <span class='it'>me</span> queer, Miss
Galbraith, but, even at that risk, I must decline
to answer such a very personal question.
And, too——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, too,” repeated Mona, stopping and
turning to look squarely at him, “you were
going to say, that I’m an eavesdropper, and,
except for your inability to be so rude, you
would tell me so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kenneth was amazed at the girl’s intuition,
but he said honestly, “You are very nearly
right, Miss Galbraith.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very nearly right? I’m exactly right, and
you know it! Now let me tell you, Mr. Kenneth
Harper, I don’t care one snip-jack for
your opinion of me, and you may think just
exactly what you choose! But I have another’s
interest at heart, and I’m perfectly justified in
asking you the question I did ask. Please tell
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the last words Mona’s voice sank to a
pleading whisper, and there was such heartfelt
urgency in her voice that he was moved against
his will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you want to know, Miss Galbraith?”
he asked, more gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were walking on again now, and Mona
looked straight before her as she replied: “I
cannot tell you that, but I beg of you to tell
me what I ask. Was it anything about me?”
Mona had no idea that it was, and this was a
purely strategic enquiry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it was not about you,—and now I hope
you’re satisfied.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I’m not satisfied. Was it about you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And was it something mean Patty had said
about you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Harper, you are not a true friend. You
know Patty Fairfield couldn’t say a mean thing
to save her life! And especially about you, one
of her best friends!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t think I’m that,” said Kenneth,
in a cynical tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are, too! Now, are you sure Patty said
this thing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Elise said so,” muttered Kenneth, who had
forgotten he was talking to a stranger, because
Mona had assumed such compelling intimacy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And are you sure it was mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, rather! You can judge for yourself!”
Kenneth’s indignation got the better of
his self-restraint, and he told Mona frankly the
truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Once, when Patty went away, I gave her a
little locket as a parting gift, and she thanked
me and said she liked it. Now, Elise tells me
that Patty told her she didn’t care a snap about
that locket, and she only wore it once or
twice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you told Miss Farrington that you
didn’t believe Patty said that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; but Elise insisted that she did say it,
and somehow I believe Elise. Her words had
the ring of truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Mr. Harper, for your confidence;”
Mona spoke very earnestly. “Believe
me, you have done no harm in telling me this.
You think it is none of my business, but it is.
You think me a queer girl, and I am. But let
me tell you one thing, Patty Fairfield is a true,
sweet, loyal nature, sound to the core; and Elise
Farrington is not above a trifling deception,
now and then, if she wishes to gain a point.
Please take me back to the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They walked the short distance in silence,
Kenneth secretly thinking that Miss Galbraith
was certainly queer; and at the same time wondering
if Elise could have made up that story.
But, as he had said, there was something in
the tone of Elise’s voice, as she repeated Patty’s
words, that convinced him they were true.
With a sigh, he went up the steps by Miss Galbraith’s
side, and then they separated, to join
other partners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dance went on, with its merriment and
gaiety, and of course no one would have known
that either Patty or Kenneth had a troubled
mind. Elise was in specially gay spirits, and
Mona seemed to be enjoying herself thoroughly.</p>

<hr class='tbk105'/>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a lovely party!” declared Elise, after
it was over and the last guest gone. “It was
just perfect. There wasn’t a flaw! Isn’t that
so, Patty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had a good time,” said Patty, a little
wearily; “but I’m awfully tired, and I’m going
right straight to bed. Good-night, everybody;
good-night, Roger,—good-night, Ken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded pleasantly to the young men, and
started up the stairs at once. Elise and Christine
followed, and, when they reached the upper
hall, Patty bade them a brief but pleasant
good-night and went straight to her own
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know what to do,” she thought to
herself, as she took off her pretty blue frock.
“I can’t let the matter go without saying a
word,—and I can’t say anything, because that
would put Elise in the wrong, and she is my
guest! I’ll just have to live it down, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it wasn’t so easily lived down. The next
morning, though Patty tried to be especially
cordial to Kenneth, he avoided her whenever
possible. Not noticeably to the others,—but
Patty realised that he did not seek her company,
or sit by her on the veranda, or ask to
ride with her in the motor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The morning dragged along, nobody seeming
to have energy enough to propose any sort of
fun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty’s birthday seems to have been too
much for this crowd,” said Nan, laughingly.
“I propose that you men all go for a swim,
and let these exhausted girlies take a little nap.
I think they danced too late, and I sha’n’t allow
such dissipation again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel fine, Mrs. Fairfield,” declared Elise.
“I never get tired dancing. Do you, Christine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I didn’t get tired,—I thought it was
a lovely party. I very seldom have an opportunity
to be in such gaieties.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you’re tired, aren’t you, Patty?” asked
Elise, as Patty sat on the veranda rail, leaning
listlessly against a pillar. Before she had
time to answer, however, a servant came walking
along the drive, whom Patty recognised as
one of the “Red Chimneys” footmen. He
brought a note, which he handed to Patty,
and then, with a deferential bow, he went
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty asked permission to read the note,
glanced it over, and then tossed it to Roger,
saying, “We seem to be especially favoured!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The note was an invitation for Patty and
Roger to come over to “Red Chimneys” at
once, but no one else was asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, Patty,” said Roger; “the others
will excuse us for a little while, I’m sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Patty and Roger walked away by the shortcut
across the two lawns, and found Mona in
the doorway awaiting them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled as she put her arm around Patty,
and said, “You’re the one I want,—I asked
Mr. Farrington for a blind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I like that!” exclaimed Roger, looking
incredulous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ll tell you,” went on Mona, smiling
at him; “the truth is, I want to see Patty privately
on a <span class='it'>very</span> important matter. I didn’t
want to send for her alone, because it looked
so conspicuous. But our private conference
won’t last more than ten minutes, and, if you
can entertain yourself that long, I’ll take care
of you afterward. Here’s the morning paper,
and do try to be patient.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mona didn’t wait for Roger’s response, but,
with her arm still around Patty, led her
to the library, took her in, and closed the
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty,” she began, “I’m a queer girl, and
you know it,—and I know it. You don’t like
me very much, but I like you, and I’d do anything
for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good gracious, Mona! What <span class='it'>are</span> you getting
at?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell you exactly what I’m getting at,—and
I’ll tell you right now. I may be queer,
but I can see a hole through a millstone when
anybody I love is concerned. Now, you know
when you and Mr. Van Reypen and I were in
the little arbour last night, we overheard somebody
talking on the other side of the thick
vines.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really, Mona, I must beg of you not to go
too far, or I may lose my temper!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, you won’t, Patty Fairfield! You
just sit still and listen. Now you know, as well
as I do, we weren’t eavesdropping,—any of us,—but
we all heard what Mr. Harper said to
Miss Farrington.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what of it?” Patty’s face was pale
and her lips were set hard together. She was
thoroughly angry at what she considered
Mona’s unwarrantable interference, and she felt
she could stand but little more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just this of it! I asked Mr. Harper what
it was that Miss Farrington told him about
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mona Galbraith! You didn’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I certainly did; and, what’s more, he told
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kenneth told you?” said Patty, incredulously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, he did. And this was it. But perhaps
you don’t want to know what it was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I do! Mona, tell me, quick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he said that Miss Farrington told
him that you didn’t care a snap about the locket
he gave you and that you only wore it once
or twice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” exclaimed Patty. “I don’t quite
understand. The locket Kenneth gave me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what she said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, for goodness’ sake! I understand now!
That locket! Why, the idea! Say, Mona,
you’re a trump to find this all out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You didn’t think so at first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I didn’t; and I’m sorry! You have
played the part of a real friend, and you’ve
done more for me than you realise! But, oh,
Mona! how <span class='it'>could</span> Elise do a thing like
that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s that sort, that’s all. You know as well
as I do she likes Kenneth Harper an awful lot,
and she knows that he likes you better than
he does her, so she’s trying to set him against
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Set Kenneth against me? She couldn’t do
it! Dear old Ken, we’re too good friends for
that! But, Mona, how did you find out all
this? You scarcely know these people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I sized up that Farrington girl the minute
I saw her! She isn’t a bit like her brother.
He’s an all-round, good sort. And the poor
chappie is still out there reading the paper!
He must be devouring the advertisements by
this time. Now, Patty, forget <span class='it'>my</span> part in this
affair, skip over home, make it up with Mr.
Harper, and do whatever you think best with
that Farrington girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t do anything with her, because she’s
my guest; but I can make it up with Ken in
just about two minutes! And, as for you,
Mona, I don’t know how to thank you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, cut it out! I’d do heaps more than
that for you, if I only had the chance! Fly
now, for you must know how impatient I am
to go and talk to my new beau, Mr. Farrington.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, after an embrace that was hearty enough
at least to indicate her gratitude, Patty flew.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='254' id='Page_254'></span><h1>CHAPTER XIX</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:0.9em;'>PHILIP’S PICNIC</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Patty’s return she found the veranda
almost deserted. Christine and Mr.
Hepworth, Elise and Mr. Van Reypen
had gone down to the beach. Mr. Fairfield had
gone to the city, and Nan was chatting with
Kenneth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ducky stepmother of mine,” said Patty, as
she wound her arm around Nan’s neck, “if
you don’t want to monopolise this young man,
I’d like to borrow him for a short time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may take him, Patty,” said Nan, with
a resigned sigh. “But I suppose you know you
will leave me alone in a cold world! Your
father has gone to New York.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Nan, you ought to have some time to
yourself. Solitude is an awfully good thing
once in a while. Don’t you sort of feel the
need of it now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I think I do,” said Nan, laughing; “so
you may have Kenneth for a while. What are
you going to do with him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take him for a spin,” said Patty, “Come
on, Ken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kenneth hesitated for a moment. “Don’t
you want to go spinning with Patty, Mrs. Fairfield?”
he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thank you; I have some household matters
to attend to. One can’t have a house party
without occasionally having an eye on domestic
affairs. So, good-bye. Be home in time for
luncheon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon Patty and Kenneth were flying along the
beach road, and the Swift Camilla was living
up to her highest reputation. Patty was driving,
and Kenneth was polite and amiable, but
not merry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a time, Patty slowed down speed a
little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kenneth,” she said, abruptly, “I’ve something
to say to you, and I’m going to say it
right straight out. You know what Elise told
you that I said about you, or rather about the
locket you gave me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know; and, by the way, it seems that
just about everybody else knows, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind that,” said Patty, knowing that
the boy was annoyed because Mona had interfered
in the matter. “The point is, Ken, that
what Elise told you I said wasn’t entirely
true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not entirely true? How much of it was
true? Since you seem to know all about her
conversation with me, I suppose she told you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, she didn’t. Now listen, Ken; I hate,
awfully, to talk against Elise, but I’ve simply
got to stand up for my own rights in this thing.
I did tell her that I only wore that locket once
or twice, but I <span class='it'>didn’t</span> tell her that I didn’t care
anything about it. For I do. I care a great
deal about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, why don’t you wear it oftener?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be perfectly frank with you, Ken. It’s
just because that locket with your picture in
it was too,—well, too personal a sort of present
for you to give me, or for me to wear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You took it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; after I’d asked father, and he told me
I might, but you know I went away with Elise
then, to Paris, and every time she saw it she
pretended that it meant a great deal more than
it did. Of course, it was only a token of our
boy and girl friendship, but she chose to pretend
it meant romance and sentiment and all
those things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But since it meant and still means our boy
and girl friendship, I think you might wear it
sometimes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see I’ll have to tell you the whole story,”
said Patty, with a little sigh. “Well, last
Christmas Elise bought a seal ring for Roger,
and then, at the last minute, she decided she’d
like to give it to you, and she asked my advice
about it. I told her it was too personal a
present for a girl to give a young man, and
I didn’t think she ought to do it. It wasn’t
that I didn’t want her to give you a nice present,
but I didn’t think it looked right for
her to give you that kind of a one. I
told her to get you books, or something like
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s all this got to do with the locket?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Elise said that I needn’t talk about
personal presents, after I had accepted from
you a locket with your picture in it. And so I
told her that that was very different, as we were
old friends, and, anyhow, I had only worn it
once or twice. But I didn’t say I didn’t care
anything for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kenneth’s face cleared, and he turned toward
Patty with an honest, beaming smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all right, Patty; I see through it now.
Elise did try to make me think you had said
something mean, but you didn’t, and I felt
sure you hadn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You didn’t feel <span class='it'>quite</span> sure, Ken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I’m ashamed to say I didn’t, at first,
but that was because I was so hurt at what I
was told you had said. But it’s all right now,
and I know you’ll forgive me, like the trump
you are. I’d grasp your strong right hand,
if I weren’t afraid that would make you steer
us both into the ocean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll consider it grasped. And I’m downright
glad that we’re good chums again, for I
hate to have squabbles with anybody, and I
almost never do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it, Patty; you’re a sweet-tempered
little thing, and I was a mean-spirited coward
to believe for a minute that you’d say anything
unkind about any of your friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Especially you, Ken;” and Patty flashed him
a glance of comradeship. “But it was Mona
who fixed this thing up for us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t she a queer girl? She’s so blunt, and
yet very few girls could have done what she
did for you, Patty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it; and I do appreciate it, and I shall
always love her for it. But, Ken, what can I
say to Elise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t say anything, Patty; that’s the best
way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, if she ever tries again to lower me in
your esteem, what then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She won’t succeed! I’ve had my little
lesson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good for you, Ken! If you ever have
reason to think that I said anything mean
about you, you come and ask me about
it,—because Mona may not be around next
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will, indeed, Patty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, peace being thoroughly established,
the trouble passed out of their minds forever,
and the old chummy relations were resumed.
They had a beautiful drive along the coast,
and, when they got back to “The Pebbles,” it
was nearly lunch time. They found the whole
crowd assembled on the veranda, and Mr. Van
Reypen seemed to be spokesman at a very important
conference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’ll be the most fun of anything you ever
saw!” he declared. “A real old-fashioned
picnic! None of your modern country-club affairs.
But a tablecloth spread on the ground,
and sandwiches and devilled eggs, and a campfire
to boil the coffee, and lemonade, and hopper-grasses
hopping in the pie, and everything just
as it should be! Oh, gorgeous!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why sit on the ground?” asked Christine.
“Aren’t there any benches in the picnic place?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re not going to a picnic grounds, little
girl,” Mr. Van Reypen informed her; “we’re
going to a real, live woods; to the darksome
depths of a dingley dell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell us all about it!” cried Patty, as she
and Kenneth joined the group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Entirely my own invention!” cried Philip;
“it’s a picnic I’m arranging for to-morrow,
and I’d be honoured if you two would deign
to attend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will that!” exclaimed Patty; “but I
heard something about grasshoppers. Do we
have to have those?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; if you prefer, you can have ants or
spiders. But you can’t have a real picnic without
some such attachments. Now listen to what
I’ve planned! It’s just too lovely! I’ve engaged
three runabouts from the amiable garage
man over forninst. Camilla will make four,
and, if Mr. and Mrs. Fairfield will lead the
parade in their own car, we’ll have an imposing
procession.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not I!” cried Nan, gaily. “If you young
people want to go on this entomological picnic,
I’ve not the slightest objection. And I’ll see
that you have enough sandwiches and devilled
eggs to feed both yourselves and the grasshoppers,
but I’ll have to ask you to excuse my husband
and myself from attending.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The only regrets I’ve had so far,” said
Philip; “anybody else who don’t want to
go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the others all declared that the plan was
perfect, and they wouldn’t miss the picnic for
anything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, I’ll run the whole show,” went on
Philip. “You understand it’s my picnic entirely,
and I’m host, and master of ceremonies,
and chief engineer. I shall provide the entire
luncheon, and, with due respects and thanks to
Mrs. Fairfield for her offer of hard-boiled eggs,
I must decline it, as I shall get all those things
from the pleasant-faced and generously proportioned
lady who is queen of the kitchen over
at my hotel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all professed themselves satisfied to let
Mr. Van Reypen take full charge of his own
picnic, and all expressed perfect willingness to
be merely passengers. Mona was present, as
usual, and was of course included in the invitation.
She was enthusiastic in her delight at the
prospect, and, quite forgetting to go home to
luncheon, she accepted Nan’s invitation to lunch
at “The Pebbles.”</p>

<hr class='tbk106'/>

<p class='pindent'>The next day proved an ideal one for Philip’s
picnic. They were to start about ten o’clock,
for he informed them the particular dingley
dell he had in mind was a fairly long distance
off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, promptly at ten o’clock, he came over to
“The Pebbles” in a runabout, accompanied by
a chauffeur. He was followed by two other
runabouts, each in charge of a chauffeur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The picnic party stood on the veranda, not
quite sure what the arrangements were to be,
but laughingly declaring they were ready to follow
orders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First,” said Mr. Van Reypen, “I’ll load up
this car;” and into the first runabout he assisted
Miss Galbraith, and bade Roger Farrington
get in beside her. Needless to say, these two
were well satisfied, and went spinning off down
the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next, turning to Mr. Hepworth, he asked him
if he could drive a car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An electric? Yes,” said Mr. Hepworth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because, if you don’t want to drive it, this
car will hold three, and you can take a
chauffeur,” said Philip, who had provided for
every emergency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I prefer to drive,” said Mr. Hepworth,
quietly, and then Philip said: “All right; and
I give you Miss Farley for a companion. Don’t
quarrel on the way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so, with Christine, Mr. Hepworth drove
away, and Philip turned to the others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hardly know how to divide up the rest
of us,” he said, stroking his chin, thoughtfully,
“but I’ll try it this way. Harper, will you
take Miss Farrington in this very pretty-looking
new runabout?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was an awkward situation, though Philip
didn’t know it. Elise was delighted with the
plan, and beamed all over her face as she took
the seat indicated. Kenneth was not at all
pleased, and it was really with difficulty that
he refrained from showing it. But Patty gave
him a pleading look, as if begging him to make
the best of the situation, and so, with what was
apparently hearty good-will, he took his seat
beside Elise, saying, “All right, here goes for
a fine ride!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kenneth was fond of driving a car, and, not
owning one himself, he rarely had the opportunity;
so Patty felt sure he would enjoy the
trip quite irrespective of who might be beside
him. And, as Patty realised, there was no other
way to arrange the couples from Mr. Van
Reypen’s viewpoint, for she knew from the
beginning that he intended to ride with
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I declare, I’m a car short!” exclaimed
Philip, as Kenneth and Elise drove away. “I
should have ordered four cars, and I only engaged
three! We’ll have to stay at home!
Shall you mind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Patty, mischievously, “I don’t
mind. I’ll read aloud to you, if you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems too bad for me not to go when it’s
my own picnic,” said Philip, musingly. “You
don’t happen to know of any little motor car
we could use, do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We might take Camilla,” suggested Patty,
in a dubious tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just the thing! Say we do? How clever
of you to think of that!” and, as Patty broke
into peals of laughter at his foolishness, Philip
flew down the steps and around to the garage,
returning in a moment with Camilla, which
Miller was impatiently holding in readiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to drive,” Philip announced,
calmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, I don’t care; but, then, you must
let me drive coming home. I declare, with a
house party, I almost never get a chance to
drive my own car!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind! Your horrid old house party
will soon be going, and then you can drive all
you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t a horrid old house party! It’s a
lovely, sweet, delicious house party, and I wish
it would stay forever!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This part of it will, if you give him the
slightest encouragement.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t want part of it unless I have it
all! I had no idea house parties were such
fun. I think we’re having beautiful times, don’t
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; since you’ve made up with young Harper;”
and Philip’s eyes twinkled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what do you mean?” exclaimed Patty,
blushing pink. “How did you know anything
about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t, and I don’t, and I don’t want to!
But when I see my little hostess going around
with a sad and forlorn expression on her face,
and one of her guests looking as if he’d lost his
last friend, and then they both go for a motor
ride and come back jubilantly chummy,—why,
then,—I Sherlock it out that they’ve had a
squabble and a make-up! Am I altogether
wrong?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not altogether,” said Patty, demurely.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='267' id='Page_267'></span><h1>CHAPTER XX</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:0.9em;'>A NARROW ESCAPE</p>

<p class='pindent'>The picnic was the real thing. That is,
it was the real old-fashioned sort of a
picnic, and it was therefore a novelty
to most of its participants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty had been on many motor picnics, where
elaborate luncheons were served by white-garbed
waiters, with the same appointments of
silver, glass, and china that she would use at
home. But not since her Vernondale days had
she attended this sort of picnic. There were
no servants. The simple but appetising luncheon
was spread on a tablecloth laid on the grass,
and, true to tradition, a grasshopper now and
then leaped in among the viands, or an audacious
spider <a id='att'></a>attempted to approach the feast.
But these were few and easily vanquished by
the brave and valiant men of the party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men, too, proved themselves capable in
the arts of fire-building and coffee-making, so
that Patty, who was a born cook and loved it,
found no use for her talent. So she and the
other girls set the table as daintily as they
could with the primitive means at their command,
and decorated it prettily with wild
flowers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As a rule,” said Elise, as she sat with a
sandwich in one hand and a glass of lemonade
in the other, “I like silver forks and china
plates at a picnic, but, for once, I do think
these wooden butter plates and paper napkins
are rather fun. What do you think, Patty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Far be it from me to cast reflections on the
goods my host provides, but, generally speaking,
I confess I like my table a few feet above
the over-attentive population of Mother
Earth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, pshaw, Patty!” exclaimed Philip.
“You’re no kind of a sport! You’re a pampered
darling of luxurious modernity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gracious! What an awful thing to be!”
cried Patty, in mock dismay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, anyway, Patty,” said the blunt Mona,
“if you hadn’t put all those old weedy flowers
on the tablecloth, there wouldn’t be any ants
and things. They’ve mostly come out of your
decorations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe you’re right,” said Patty, laughing.
“So the picnic is a success after all,
and it’s only our decorations that made any
trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then they all ate heartily of the feast, and
there was much laughter and merriment, and
afterward they sat round the fire and told
stories and sang songs, and they all declared
it was the very nicest picnic ever was, and they
were sorry when it was time to go home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we must be going,” Patty said, “for I
promised Nan we’d be home in ample time to
dress for dinner, and it’s a fairly long ride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do we go back the same way we came?”
asked Elise, looking at Philip with an arch air
of enquiry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go back any way you please, fair lady,” he
replied. “The way we came is the shortest, but
there is a longer way round, if you prefer it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t mean that,” said Elise. “I mean
do we go with the same partners?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do,” declared Philip, “and Miss Fairfield
does. The rest of you may do just as you
choose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I think we’ll go as we came,” said
Elise, with an air of satisfaction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The simplicity of Philip’s picnic made it an
easy matter to pack up to go home, as there
was little beside the tablecloth to take with
them, and so they were soon ready for the
homeward trip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As host, Philip sent off the other cars first,
and, after they were all started, he stepped into
the Swift Camilla, beside Patty, who was already
in the driving seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to drive home, you know,” she
said. “I’m simply dying to get hold of this
steering bar once more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right; you may drive, but let’s go round
the other route; it’s only a little bit longer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much longer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not more than a mile or two,—two at the
most.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you sure of that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Positive!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right; then we’ve time enough. Where
do we turn off?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At this next turn to the left. That takes
us around past Berry Hill, and so on around
by Blue Lake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, I know the way after we reach
Blue Lake. Here we go, then!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty took the turn Philip had indicated, and,
as she did so, she caught the last glimpse of the
other three cars disappearing in the distance
as they went home by the same road they came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The road she had turned into was far more
picturesque and beautiful, and, as this portion
of it was new to her, she was delighted to
see it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What high hills!” she exclaimed. “Why,
they’re almost mountains!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hardly that; but they are fairly high hills,
to be so near the seashore. Don’t you want me
to drive, Patty? This road has sharp corners,
and around these hills it’s hard to see anybody
coming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I’ll drive and you keep a watch out.
We haven’t met a car yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, and I wonder at it. Usually there are
lots of racers and touring cars along here. But,
of course, it’s early in the season for them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is that you are so familiar with this
locality? You seem to know all about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I spent a summer down here some years ago.
That’s how I knew where that picnic ground is.
Look out, there’s a bad place in the road!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Patty had already seen it, and was skilfully
steering so as to avoid it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see everything,” said Philip, admiringly;
“you’re a wonderful little motorist! I
never saw anybody drive better than you do;
and so easily, too. Merciful Heavens!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty gave a jump at Philip’s excited exclamation,
and saw, straight in front of her, an immense
red car at full speed. It had swung
around a sharp angle, and could not possibly
have been seen by them until it burst on their
vision not twenty yards away. They had
heard no signal, which was culpable carelessness
on the part of the driver of the big car,
and perhaps Patty was equally culpable in not
having sounded her own horn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this was no time to think of such matters,
for they were really in perilous danger.
The driver of the big car did nothing to avert
disaster. It could not be he was indifferent to
the awful situation; he looked more as if he
were stunned by the sudden realisation of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty was absolutely paralysed with fear. She
realised fully their plight, she knew that nothing
could save them from instant and terrible
collision, and her muscles were absolutely powerless
to move.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The short distance between the two cars diminished
like lightning, and neither car had
swerved from a straight line leading to the
other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty tried to shriek, but her stiffened tongue
gave forth no sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At sight of the big car, Philip Van Reypen
was stunned also. But, in an instant, he recovered
his senses, and, in another instant, he had
shot out his right hand and, seizing the controller
handle, pushed it backward with a force
that nearly crushed Patty’s hand that held it.
Then, grasping the steering bar with his other
hand, he swerved the car over to the right,
blindly trying to find the reverse lever with his
foot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then happened what Philip knew would happen.
The Camilla banged into a sheer cliff
of rock, but took it sideways. He grasped
Patty as the car stopped, and they were both
jolted backward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By presence of mind and quick action, he had
run the car into the cliff, causing thereby a
minor smash-up, instead of meeting the big red
car in a head-on collision, which would surely
have meant fatality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty was very white, but she did not faint.
The shock restored her numbed senses, and
she turned to Philip with a glance of perfect
understanding of what he had done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Patty,” he whispered, in a tense voice,
“thank Heaven you’re safe!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a miracle, Philip; but you did it yourself!
I knew it at the time, my brain worked
perfectly, but my muscles were paralysed by
fear. Oh, suppose yours had been, too!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could have done better if I could have
sensed the thing an instant sooner. For a
second my brain wouldn’t work, and then I saw
my way clear, like a flash, but it was too late!
I hadn’t time to back or to get across in front
of the car. It was either to run into this cliff,
or have that immense machine run into us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was splendid!” said Patty, the tears coming
to her eyes; and then the reaction from the
shock came, and she burst into violent sobbing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t, Patty; don’t do that,” said Philip,
in a pained voice, and Patty looked up, smiling
through her tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not really crying,” she said; “it’s just
a foolish reaction, and I can’t help it. I’m sorry
to be so silly, but I’m just a little hysterical
from,—from joy, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You behaved splendidly, Patty! If you had
moved hand or foot, we would have been
dashed to pieces. It was only because I could
get full command of the controller and the
steering bar that I could manage at all. If you
had given a convulsive push the other way,—well,
never mind that! But I expect I crushed
your hand when I grasped the controller. I
had to, to make sure that you didn’t jerk it the
other way unintentionally.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess you did hurt my hand;” and Patty
held it up to see. Sure enough, black and blue
bruises already appeared on fingers and palm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor little hand,” said Philip, taking it in
his own. “I’m so sorry, Patty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t talk to me like that!” exclaimed
Patty, “as if I were a molly-coddle! I’m glad
you smashed my hand, as that was the only
way to save us from——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From certain death,” said Philip, gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then they heard a motor coming behind
them, and, looking up, found a good-sized touring
car, which was about to pass them, but had
stopped at their side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Want help?” called out a cheery voice, and
Philip answered, “Indeed, we do!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stranger jumped out of his car, and came
over to inspect the Camilla.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ought to get out,” whispered Philip. “Are
you brave enough to sit here alone, Patty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course; Camilla can’t run away now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philip and the other man looked about to see
what had really happened to Patty’s car. There
was not so much damage as it seemed at first,
for, with the exception of a smashed mudguard,
and some dents and bruises, nothing was broken,
except the shaft drive axle. But this, of course,
rendered the car helpless as to her motor,
though her running gear was all right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll give you a tow,” said the stranger heartily.
“Where do you want to go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Spring Beach,” answered Philip. “Are
you going that way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can go that way as well as not, and, when
people come as near death and destruction as
you people did, I think it’s only human to take
you home. Perfect marvel, though, how you
escaped with so little injury to the car!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perfect marvel how we escaped at all!” said
Philip. “I did what I could, but, when I see
the narrow margin we had on either side, I
wonder we weren’t smashed to bits, anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a wonder!” said the stranger. “Most
marvellous thing I ever saw,—and I’ve seen
lots of motor accidents. My name’s Hampton,—Henry
Hampton,—and now, if you’ll help me
rig up the tow, I’ll pull you home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so, after a short time, Philip and Patty,
still seated in the damaged Camilla, went swiftly
along, towed by kind-hearted Henry Hampton’s
powerful car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, when they reached “The Pebbles,”
an anxious crowd awaited them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s getting to be sort of a habit, our getting
home late, with an accident to report,” said
Philip, as they turned in the gate, and Patty
couldn’t help smiling, though her nerves were
still tingling from the recent shock, and from
the realisation of their wonderful escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The laughing crowd on the veranda grew suddenly
still as they saw a strange motor enter the
gate with the Camilla in tow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What has happened?” cried Nan, as they
came within hearing distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re all right, father!” called out Patty,
anxious to allay the look of fear and consternation
on her father’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty, dear child, what is it?” exclaimed
Mr. Fairfield, as he lifted Patty, still white
and trembling, out of the car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An accident, father,—an awful accident!
And Philip was the hero this time; he saved
my life, and he did it in a most wonderful way!
I’ll tell you about it sometime, but I can’t now;”
and Patty fell limply into her father’s arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind, darling, it’s all right,” said Mr.
Fairfield, soothingly, as he kissed the pale brow,
and carried Patty up the steps and into the
house. He laid her on a couch, and, under
Nan’s gentle ministrations, she soon revived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meantime, Henry Hampton was telling the
tale as he had understood it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mighty slick piece of work!” he said.
“Never saw anything like it in my life! That
young fellow ought to have medals pinned all
over him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, there, Mr. Hampton, that’ll be about
all,” said Philip, trying to shut off the tide of
compliments from the stranger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, ’taint about all!” declared Mr. Hampton,
wagging his head, “but I guess the little
lady can tell you the story, once she feels like
herself again. I must be gettin’ along now,
but I just want to remark, edgewise, that I’ve
seen lots of pluck and bravery in my day, but
for hair-trigger intellect, coolheadedness, pluck,
and plumb bravery, I never saw such an exhibition
as this here chap put up to-day! Good-afternoon,
all;” and, with a wave of his hand,
Mr. Hampton went away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philip was the hero of the hour, but he would
not admit that he had done anything praiseworthy
or unusual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was only one thing to do,” he said;
“only one possible chance to take, and of course
I took it; and almost by a miracle it went
through all right, and we smashed the car, but
saved our lives.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you listen to him!” called out Patty.
“You people come in here, and I’ll tell you all
about it! I was driving, and it was next to
impossible for Philip to get hold of the bars,
across <span class='it'>me</span>. But he did it! and he did it in time!
and he did it exactly right! And I just sat there
paralysed with fear, and unable to move. But
I suppose you don’t expect a girl to be very
brave,—and I sort of collapsed, I know. But
Philip is a hero, and I want him appreciated
as such.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is, Patty dear,” said her father; “and,
though he’s awfully modest himself about his
brave deed, he has the honour and respect and
gratitude of all of us for his wonderful quickness
of brain and hand that saved his own life,—and
that of my little girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Fairfield’s voice broke as he folded Patty
in his arms, and he kissed her with all of a father’s
love for the treasure he had so nearly
lost.</p>

plain-spoken and business like, took what she called a
“job” in a department store. The experiences of these
girls make fascinating reading—life in the great metropolis

<p class='pindent'>Among her “fan” letters Lilian Garis receives some flattering
testimonials of her girl readers’ interest in her stories.
From a class of thirty comes a vote of twenty-five naming
her as their favorite author. Perhaps it is the element of
live mystery that Mrs. Garis always builds her stories upon,
or perhaps it is because the girls easily can translate her
own sincere interest in themselves from the stories. At
any rate her books prosper through the changing conditions
of these times, giving pleasure, satisfaction, and,
incidentally, that tactful word of inspiration, so important
in literature for young girls. Mrs. Garis prefers to call her
books “juvenile novels” and in them romance is never
lacking.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
